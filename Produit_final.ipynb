The level of confidence associated with each key finding is reported using \\nthe IPCC calibrated language.3 The underlying scientific basis of each key finding is indicated by references provided to chapter \\nelements. In the SPM, knowledge gaps are identified associated with the underlying chapters of the Report.\\nA. Understanding Global Warming of 1.5°C4\\nA.1 Human activities are estimated to have caused approximately 1.0°C of global warming5 above \\npre-industrial levels, with a likely range of 0.8°C to 1.2°C. Global warming is likely to reach 1.5°C \\nbetween 2030 and 2052 if it continues to increase at the current rate. (high confidence) (Figure \\nSPM.1) {1.2}\\nA.1.1 Reflecting the long-term warming trend since pre-industrial times, observed global mean surface temperature (GMST) for \\nthe decade 2006–2015 was 0.87°C (likely between 0.75°C and 0.99°C)6 higher than the average over the 1850–1900 \\nperiod (very high confidence). Estimated anthropogenic global warming matches the level of observed warming to within \\n±20% (likely range). Estimated anthropogenic global warming is currently increasing at 0.2°C (likely between 0.1°C and \\n0.3°C) per decade due to past and ongoing emissions (high confidence). {1.2.1, Table 1.1, 1.2.4}\\nA.1.2 Warming greater than the global annual average is being experienced in many land regions and seasons, including two to \\nthree times higher in the Arctic. Warming is generally higher over land than over the ocean. (high confidence) {1.2.1, 1.2.2, \\nFigure 1.1, Figure 1.3, 3.3.1, 3.3.2}\\nA.1.3 Trends in intensity and frequency of some climate and weather extremes have been detected over time spans during which \\nabout 0.5°C of global warming occurred (medium confidence). This assessment is based on several lines of evidence, \\nincluding attribution studies for changes in extremes since 1950. {3.3.1, 3.3.2, 3.3.3} \\n1 Decision 1/CP .21, paragraph 21.\\n2 The assessment covers literature accepted for publication by 15 May 2018.\\n3 Each finding is grounded in an evaluation of underlying evidence and agreement. A level of confidence is expressed using five qualifiers: very low, low, medium, high and very high, and  \\n typeset in italics, for example, medium confidence. The following terms have been used to indicate the assessed likelihood of an outcome or a result: virtually certain 99–100%  \\n probability, very likely 90–100%, likely 66–100%, about as likely as not 33–66%, unlikely 0–33%, very unlikely 0–10%, exceptionally unlikely 0–1%. Additional terms (extremely likely  \\n 95–100%, more likely than not >50–100%, more unlikely than likely 0–<50%, extremely unlikely 0–5%) may also be used when appropriate. Assessed likelihood is typeset in italics,  \\n for example, very likely. This is consistent with AR5. \\n4 See also Box SPM.1: Core Concepts Central to this Special Report.\\n5 Present level of global warming is defined as the average of a 30-year period centred on 2017 assuming the recent rate of warming continues.\\n6 This range spans the four available peer-reviewed estimates of the observed GMST change and also accounts for additional uncertainty due to possible short-term natural variability.  \\n {1.2.1, Table 1.1}'}\n",
            "{'document': 'warming.pdf', 'page': 4, 'content': 'SPM Summary for Policymakers5A.2 Warming from anthropogenic emissions from the pre-industrial period to the present will persist for \\ncenturies to millennia and will continue to cause further long-term changes in the climate system, \\nsuch as sea level rise, with associated impacts (high confidence), but these emissions alone are \\nunlikely to cause global warming of 1.5°C (medium confidence). (Figure SPM.1) {1.2, 3.3, Figure 1.5}\\nA.2.1 Anthropogenic emissions (including greenhouse gases, aerosols and their precursors) up to the present are unlikely to \\ncause further warming of more than 0.5°C over the next two to three decades (high confidence) or on a century time scale \\n(medium confidence). {1.2.4, Figure 1.5}\\nA.2.2 Reaching and sustaining net zero global anthropogenic CO2 emissions and declining net non-CO2 radiative forcing would \\nhalt anthropogenic global warming on multi-decadal time scales (high confidence). The maximum temperature reached is \\nthen determined by cumulative net global anthropogenic CO2 emissions up to the time of net zero CO2 emissions (high \\nconfidence) and the level of non-CO2 radiative forcing in the decades prior to the time that maximum temperatures are \\nreached (medium confidence). On longer time scales, sustained net negative global anthropogenic CO2 emissions and/\\nor further reductions in non-CO2 radiative forcing may still be required to prevent further warming due to Earth system \\nfeedbacks and to reverse ocean acidification (medium confidence) and will be required to minimize sea level rise (high \\nconfidence). {Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 1, 1.2.3, 1.2.4, Figure 1.4, 2.2.1, 2.2.2, 3.4.4.8, 3.4.5.1, 3.6.3.2}\\nA.3 Climate-related risks for natural and human systems are higher for global warming of 1.5°C than \\nat present, but lower than at 2°C (high confidence). These risks depend on the magnitude and rate \\nof warming, geographic location, levels of development and vulnerability, and on the choices and \\nimplementation of adaptation and mitigation options (high confidence). (Figure SPM.2) {1.3, 3.3, \\n3.4, 5.6}\\nA.3.1 Impacts on natural and human systems from global warming have already been observed (high confidence). Many land and \\nocean ecosystems and some of the services they provide have already changed due to global warming (high confidence). \\n(Figure SPM.2) {1.4, 3.4, 3.5}\\nA.3.2 Future climate-related risks depend on the rate, peak and duration of warming. In the aggregate, they are larger if global \\nwarming exceeds 1.5°C before returning to that level by 2100 than if global warming gradually stabilizes at 1.5°C, especially \\nif the peak temperature is high (e.g., about 2°C) (high confidence). Some impacts may be long-lasting or irreversible, such \\nas the loss of some ecosystems (high confidence). {3.2, 3.4.4, 3.6.3, Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3}\\nA.3.3 Adaptation and mitigation are already occurring (high confidence). Future climate-related risks would be reduced by the \\nupscaling and acceleration of far-reaching, multilevel and cross-sectoral climate mitigation and by both incremental and \\ntransformational adaptation (high confidence). {1.2, 1.3, Table 3.5, 4.2.2, Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 4, Box 4.2, Box \\n4.3, Box 4.6, 4.3.1, 4.3.2, 4.3.3, 4.3.4, 4.3.5, 4.4.1, 4.4.4, 4.4.5, 4.5.3}  '}\n",

Projected Climate Change, Potential Impacts and Associated Risks\\nB.1 Climate models project robust7 differences in regional climate characteristics between present-day \\nand global warming of 1.5°C,8 and between 1.5°C and 2°C.8 These differences include increases \\nin: mean temperature in most land and ocean regions (high confidence), hot extremes in most \\ninhabited regions (high confidence), heavy precipitation in several regions (medium confidence), \\nand the probability of drought and precipitation deficits in some regions (medium confidence). \\n{3.3}\\nB.1.1 Evidence from attributed changes in some climate and weather extremes for a global warming of about 0.5°C supports \\nthe assessment that an additional 0.5°C of warming compared to present is associated with further detectable changes in \\nthese extremes (medium confidence). Several regional changes in climate are assessed to occur with global warming up \\nto 1.5°C compared to pre-industrial levels, including warming of extreme temperatures in many regions (high confidence), \\nincreases in frequency, intensity, and/or amount of heavy precipitation in several regions (high confidence), and an increase \\nin intensity or frequency of droughts in some regions (medium confidence). {3.2, 3.3.1, 3.3.2, 3.3.3, 3.3.4, Table 3.2}\\nB.1.2 Temperature extremes on land are projected to warm more than GMST (high confidence): extreme hot days in mid-latitudes \\nwarm by up to about 3°C at global warming of 1.5°C and about 4°C at 2°C, and extreme cold nights in high latitudes warm \\nby up to about 4.5°C at 1.5°C and about 6°C at 2°C (high confidence).

The assessment is based on literature on mitigation options that are considered relevant for 1.5°C. The assessed strength of the SDG \\ninteractions is based on the qualitative and quantitative assessment of individual mitigation options listed in Table 5.2.

The strength of the connection considers only the effect of mitigation and does not include benefits of avoided impacts.

TS.6 (Chapter 6) examines extremes and abrupt or irreversible changes in the ocean and cryosphere in a changing climate, and identiﬁes sustainable and resilient risk management strategies. All chapters and their Executive Summaries build on ﬁndings since the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) and, \\nwhenever applicable, outcomes of the IPCC Special Report on Global \\nWarming of 1.5ºC (SR15) .\\nSROCC uses IPCC calibrated language\\n1 for the communication of \\nconﬁdence in the assessment process (see Chapter 1 and references \\ntherein). This calibrated language is designed to consistently \\nevaluate and communicate uncertainties that arise from incomplete \\nknowledge due to a lack of information, or from disagreement about \\nwhat is known or even knowable. The IPCC calibrated language \\nuses qualitative expressions of conﬁdence based on the robustness \\nof evidence for a ﬁnding, and (where possible) uses quantitative expressions to describe the likelihood of a ﬁnding (Figure TS.1). \\n1 Each ﬁnding is grounded in an evaluation of underlying evidence and agreement. The summary terms for evidence are: limited, med ium or robust. For agreement, they are \\nlow, medium or high. In many cases, a synthesis of evidence and agreement supports an assignment of conﬁdence. A level of conﬁd ence is expressed using ﬁve qualiﬁers: \\nvery low, low, medium, high and very high, and typeset in italics, e.g., medium conﬁdence . The following terms have been used to indicate the assessed likelihood of an \\noutcome or a result: virtually certain 99–100% probability, very likely 90–100%, likely 66–100%, about as likely as not 33–66%,  unlikely 0–33%, very unlikely 0–10%, \\nexceptionally unlikely 0–1%. Additional terms (extremely likely 95–100%, more likely than not >50–100%, more unlikely than like ly 0–<50%, extremely unlikely 0–5%) \\nmay also be used when appropriate. Assessed likelihood is typeset in italics, e.g., very likely . This Report also uses the term ‘likely range’ or ‘very likely range’ to indicate \\nthat the assessed likelihood of an outcome lies within the 17–83% or 5–95% probability range.

Chapter\\xa0 1 provides context on the importance of the ocean and cryosphere, and the framework for the assessments in subsequent chapters of the report.\\nAll people on Earth depend directly or indirectly on the \\nocean and cryosphere. The fundamental roles of the ocean and \\ncryosphere in the Earth system include the uptake and redistribution \\nof anthropogenic carbon dioxide and heat by the ocean, as well as \\ntheir crucial involvement of in the hydrological cycle. The cryosphere \\nalso ampliﬁes climate changes through snow, ice and permafrost \\nfeedbacks. Services provided to people by the ocean and/or cryosphere include food and freshwater, renewable energy,\\xa0 health and wellbeing, cultural values, trade and transport. {1.1, 1.2, 1.5, \\nFigure TS.2}\\nSustainable development is at risk from emerging and \\nintensifying ocean and cryosphere changes.  Ocean and \\ncryosphere changes interact with each of the\\n United Nations \\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Progress on climate action \\n(SDG 13) would reduce risks to aspects of sustainable development that are fundamentally linked to the ocean and cryosphere and \\nthe\\xa0services they provide ( high conﬁdence ). Progress on achieving the  \\nSDGs can contribute to reducing the exposure or vulnerabilities of people and communities to the risks of ocean and cryosphere change (medium conﬁdence ). {1.1}\\nCommunities living in close connection with polar, mountain, \\nand coastal environments are particularly exposed to the \\ncurrent and future hazards\\n of ocean and cryosphere change.  \\nCoasts are home to approximately 28% of the global population, including around 11% living on land less than 10\\xa0m above sea level. Almost 10% of the global population lives in the Arctic or high \\nmountain regions. People in these regions face the greatest exposure \\nto ocean and cryosphere change, and poor and marginalised people \\nhere are particularly vulnerable to climate-related hazards and risks (very high conﬁdence ). The adaptive capacity of people, communities \\nand nations is shaped by social, political, cultural, economic, technological, institutional, geographical and demographic factors.  \\n{1.1, 1.5, 1.6, Cross-Chapter Box\\xa02 in Chapter\\xa01}\\nOcean and cryosphere changes are pervasive and observed \\nfrom high mountains, to the polar regions, to coasts, and into \\nthe deep ocean. AR5 assessed that the ocean is warming (0\\n to \\n700\\xa0m:  virtually certain; 700 to 2000\\xa0m:  likely ), sea level is rising ( high \\nconﬁdence ), and ocean acidity is increasing ( high conﬁdence ).

Changes in some variables have occurred since the pre-industrial period.\\n3 This scaling factor (global-mean ocean expansion as sea level rise in metres per unit heat) varies by about 10% between differe nt models, and it will systematically increase \\nby about 10% by 2100 under RCP8.5 forcing due to ocean warming increasing the average thermal expansion coefﬁcient. {4.2.1, 4.2 .2, 5.2.2}\\n4 Antarctic sea ice is not shown here due to low conﬁdence in future projections. {3.2.2}snow cover is decreasing ( very high conﬁdence ), and permafrost \\ntemperatures are increasing ( high conﬁdence ). Improvements \\nsince AR5 in observation systems, techniques, reconstructions and model developments, have advanced scientiﬁc characterisation and understanding of ocean and cryosphere change, including in previously \\nidentiﬁed areas of concern such as ice sheets and Atlantic Meridional \\nOverturning Circulation (AMOC). {1.1, 1.4, 1.8.1, Figure TS.3}\\nEvidence and understanding of the human causes of climate \\nwarming, and of associated ocean and cryosphere changes, \\nhas increased over the past 30 years of IPCC assessments ( very \\nhigh conﬁdence ). Human activities are estimated to have caused \\napproximately 1.0ºC of global warming above pre-industrial levels \\n(SR15). Areas of concern in earlier IPCC reports, such as the expected \\nacceleration of sea level rise, are now observed ( high conﬁdence ). \\nEvidence for expected slow-down of AMOC is emerging in sustained observations and from long-term palaeoclimate reconstructions (medium conﬁdence ), and may be related with anthropogenic forcing \\naccording to model simulations, although this remains to be properly \\nattributed. Signiﬁcant sea level rise contributions from Antarctic ice \\nsheet mass loss ( very high conﬁdence ), which earlier reports did not \\nexpect to manifest this century, are already being observed. {1.1, 1.4}\\nOcean and cryosphere changes and risks by the end-of-century \\n(2081–2100) will be larger under high greenhouse gas emission scenarios, compared with low emission scenarios ( very high \\nconﬁdence ). Projections and assessments of future climate, ocean \\nand cryosphere changes in the Special Report on the Ocean and \\nCryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC) are commonly based \\non coordinated climate model experiments from the Coupled Model \\nIntercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) forced with Representative \\nConcentration Pathways (RCPs) of future radiative forcing. Current \\nemissions continue to grow at a rate consistent with a high emission \\nfuture without effective climate change mitigation policies (referred \\nto as RCP8.5). The SROCC assessment contrasts this high greenhouse \\ngas emission future with a low greenhouse gas emission, high \\nmitigation future (referred to as RCP2.6) that gives a two in three \\nchance of limiting warming by the end of the century to less than 2\\noC \\nabove pre-industrial. {Cross-Chapter Box\\xa01 in Chapter 1, Table TS.2} Characteristics of ocean and cryosphere change include \\nthresholds of abrupt change, long-term changes that cannot be avoided, and irreversibility ( high conﬁdence ). Ocean warming, \\nacidiﬁcation and deoxygenation, ice sheet and glacier mass loss, and \\npermafrost degradation are expected to be irreversible on time scales \\nrelevant to human societies and ecosystems. Long response times \\nof decades to millennia mean that the ocean and cryosphere are \\ncommitted to long-term change even after atmospheric greenhouse \\ngas concentrations and radiative forcing stabilise ( high conﬁdence ). \\nIce-melt or the thawing of permafrost involve thresholds (state \\nchanges) that allow for abrupt, nonlinear responses to ongoing \\nclimate warming ( high conﬁdence ). These characteristics of ocean \\nand cryosphere change pose risks and challenges to adaptation.  \\n{1.1, Box\\xa01.1, 1.3}\\nSocieties will be exposed, and challenged to adapt, to changes \\nin the ocean and cryosphere even if current and future efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions keep global warming well below 2ºC ( very high conﬁdence ). Ocean and cryosphere-related \\nmitigation and adaptation measures include options that address the \\ncauses of climate change, support biological and ecological adaptation, or enhance societal adaptation. Most ocean-based local mitigation and adaptation measures have limited effectiveness to mitigate climate change and reduce its consequences at the global scale, but are useful to implement because they address local risks, often have \\nco-beneﬁts such as biodiversity conservation, and have few adverse \\nside effects. Effective mitigation at a global scale will reduce the need \\nand cost of adaptation, and reduce the risks of surpassing limits to \\nadaptation. Ocean-based carbon dioxide removal at the global scale \\nhas potentially large negative ecosystem consequences. {1.6.1, 1.6.2, \\nCross-Chapter Box\\xa02 in Chapter 1, Figure TS.4}\\nThe scale and cross-boundary dimensions of changes in the \\nocean and cryosphere challenge the ability  of communities, \\ncultures and nations to respond effectively within existing \\ngovernance frameworks ( high conﬁdence ).

Widespread \\ncryosphere changes affect physical, biological and human systems in the mountains and surrounding lowlands, with impacts evident even in the ocean. Building on the IPCC’s 5th Assessment Report (AR5), this chapter assesses new evidence on observed recent and projected changes in the mountain cryosphere as well as associated impacts, risks and adaptation measures related to natural and human systems. Impacts in response to climate changes independently of changes in \\nthe cryosphere are not assessed in this chapter.

(a) shows the combined risk of coastal ﬂooding, erosion and salinization for illustrative geographies in 2100, due to changing mea n and \\nextreme sea levels under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 and under two response scenarios. Risks under RCPs 4.5 and 6.0 were not assessed due  to a lack of literature for the \\nassessed geographies.

Panel (a) considers a socioeconomic scenario with relatively stable \\ncoastal population density over the century. {SM4.3.2} Risks to illustrative geographies have been assessed based on relative s ea level changes projected for a set of \\nspeciﬁc examples: New York City, Shanghai and Rotterdam for resource-rich coastal cities covering a wide range of response expe riences; South Tarawa, Fongafale and \\nMale’ for urban atoll islands; Mekong and Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna for large tropical agricultural deltas; and Bykovskiy, Shis hmaref, Kivalina, Tuktoyaktuk and Shingle \\nPoint for Arctic communities located in regions remote from rapid glacio-isostatic adjustment. {4.2, 4.3.4, SM4.2} The assessme nt distinguishes between two contrasting \\nresponse scenarios. “No-to-moderate response” describes efforts as of today (i.e., no further signiﬁcant action or new types of  actions). “Maximum potential response” \\nrepresents a combination of responses implemented to their full extent and thus signiﬁcant additional efforts compared to today , assuming minimal ﬁnancial, social and \\npolitical barriers. The assessment has been conducted for each sea level rise and response scenario, as indicated by the burnin g embers in the ﬁgure; in-between risk levels \\nare interpolated. {4.3.3} The assessment criteria include exposure and vulnerability (density of assets, level of degradation o f terrestrial and marine buffer ecosystems), \\ncoastal hazards (ﬂooding, shoreline erosion, salinization), in-situ responses (hard engineered coastal defenses, ecosystem rest oration or creation of new natural buffers \\nareas, and subsidence management) and planned relocation. Planned relocation refers to managed retreat or resettlement as descr ibed in Chapter 4, i.e., proactive and \\nlocal-scale measures to reduce risk by relocating people, assets and infrastructure. Forced displacement is not considered in t his assessment. Panel  (a) also highlights the \\nrelative contributions of in-situ responses and planned relocation to the total risk reduction.

The global biomass of marine animals, including those \\nthat contribute to ﬁsheries, is projected to decrease with a very likely  \\nrange under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 of 4.3 ± 2.0% and 15.0 ± 5.9%, \\nrespectively, by 2080–2099 relative to 1986–2005.

Some increases are \\nprojected in the polar regions, due to enhanced stratiﬁcation in \\nthe surface ocean, reduced primary production and shifts towards \\nsmall phytoplankton ( medium conﬁdence ). The projected impacts on \\nbiomass in the abyssal seaﬂoor are larger under RCP8.5 than RCP4.5 \\n(very likely ). The increase in climatic hazards beyond thresholds of \\ntolerance of deep sea organisms will increase the risk of loss of \\nbiodiversity and impacts on functioning of deep water column and \\nseaﬂoor that is important to support ecosystem services, such as \\ncarbon sequestration ( medium conﬁdence ). {5.2.4}\\nStructure and functions of all types of coastal ecosystems \\nwill continue to be at moderate to high risk under the \\nRCP2.6 scenario ( medium conﬁdence ) and will face high to \\nvery high risk under the RCP8.5 scenario ( high conﬁdence ) \\nby 2100.

Some ocean indices are expected \\nto emerge earlier than others (e.g.,\\xa0 warming, acidiﬁcation and effects on ﬁsh stocks) and could therefore be used to prioritise planning and building resilience. The survival of some keystone ecosystems (e.g.,\\xa0coral reefs) are at risk, while governance structures are not well-matched to the spatial and temporal scale of climate change impacts on ocean systems. Ecosystem restoration may be able to locally reduce climate risks ( medium conﬁdence ) but at relatively high cost and \\neffectiveness limited to low emissions scenarios and to less \\nsensitive systems ( high conﬁdence ). {5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5}Coastal blue carbon ecosystems, such as mangroves, salt \\nmarshes and seagrasses, can help reduce the risks and impacts of climate change, with multiple co-beneﬁts.  Some 151 countries \\naround the world contain at least one of these coastal blue carbon ecosystems and 71 countries contain all three. Below-ground carbon storage in vegetated marine habitats can be up to 1000 tC ha\\n–1, much \\nhigher than most terrestrial ecosystems ( high conﬁdence ). Successful \\nimplementation of measures to maintain and promote carbon storage in such coastal ecosystems could assist several countries in achieving a balance between emissions and removals of greenhouse gases ( medium conﬁdence ). Conservation of these habitats would \\nalso sustain the wide range of ecosystem services they provide and assist with climate adaptation through improving critical habitats for biodiversity, enhancing local ﬁsheries production, and protecting \\ncoastal communities from SLR and storm events ( high conﬁdence ). \\nThe climate mitigation effectiveness of other natural carbon removal processes in coastal waters, such as seaweed ecosystems and proposed non-biological marine CO\\n2 removal methods, are smaller or \\ncurrently have higher associated uncertainties. Seaweed aquaculture \\nwarrants further research attention. {5.5.1.1, 5.5.1.1, 5.5.1, 5.5.2, 5.5.1.1.3, 5.5.1.1.4}\\nThe potential climatic beneﬁts of blue carbon ecosystems \\ncan only be a very modest addition to, and not a replacement \\nfor, the very rapid reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.  \\nThe maximum global mitigation beneﬁts of cost-effective coastal \\nwetland restoration is unlikely  to be more than 2% of current \\n \\ntotal emissions from all sources. Nevertheless, the protection \\nand enhancement of coastal blue carbon can be an important \\ncontribution to both mitigation and adaptation at the national scale. \\nThe feasibility of climate mitigation by open ocean fertilisation of \\nproductivity is limited to negligible, due to the likely decadal-scale \\nreturn to the atmosphere of nearly all the extra carbon removed, \\nassociated difﬁculties in carbon accounting, risks of unintended \\nside effects and low acceptability. Other human interventions to \\nenhance marine carbon uptake, for example, ocean alkalinisation \\n(enhanced weathering), would also have governance challenges, \\nwith the increased risk of undesirable ecological consequences ( high \\nconﬁdence ). {5.5.1.2}\\nSocioinstitutional adaptation responses are more frequently \\nreported in the literature than ecosystem-based and built \\ninfrastructure approaches.  Hard engineering responses are more \\neffective when supported by ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) \\napproaches ( high agreement ), and both approaches are enhanced by \\ncombining with socioinstitutional approaches for adaptation ( high \\nconﬁdence ).

If carbon emissions decline, the risk of \\nextremes and abrupt changes are reduced, creating co-beneﬁts. {6.8.6}\\nFor TCs and ETCs, investment in disaster risk reduction, ﬂood \\nmanagement (ecosystem and engineered) and early warning systems decreases economic loss ( medium conﬁdence ), but \\nsuch investments may be hindered by limited local capacities, such as increased losses and mortality from extreme winds and storm surges in less developed countries despite adaptation efforts. There is emerging evidence of increasing risks for locations \\nimpacted by unprecedented storm trajectories ( low conﬁdence ). \\nManaging the risk from such changing storm trajectories and intensity \\nproves challenging because of the difﬁculties of early warning and its \\nreceptivity by the affected population ( high conﬁdence ). {6.3, 6.9}\\nLimiting global warming would reduce the risk of impacts of \\nMHWs, but critical thresholds for some ecosystems (e.g., kelp \\nforests, coral reefs) will be reached at relatively low levels of \\nfuture global warming ( high conﬁdence ). Early warning systems, \\nproducing skillful forecasts of MHWs, can further help to reduce the \\nvulnerability in the areas of ﬁsheries, tourism and conservation, but \\nare yet unproven at large scale ( medium conﬁdence ). {6.4}\\nSustained long-term monitoring and improved forecasts \\ncan be used in managing the risks of extreme El Niño and La Niña events associated with human health, agriculture, ﬁsheries, coral reefs, aquaculture, wildﬁre, drought and ﬂood \\nmanagement ( high conﬁdence ). {6.5}\\nExtreme change in the trade wind system and its impacts \\non global variability, biogeochemistry, ecosystems and \\nsociety have not been adequately understood and represent \\nsigniﬁcant knowledge gaps. {6.6}\\nBy 2300, an AMOC collapse is as likely as not for high emission \\npathways and very unlikely for lower ones, highlighting that \\nan AMOC collapse can be avoided in the long term by CO\\n2 \\nmitigation ( medium conﬁdence ).

Investing in preparation and prevention against the impacts from extreme events is very likely less than the cost of impacts and recovery ( medium \\nconﬁdence ). Coupling insurance mechanisms with risk reduction \\nmeasures can enhance the cost-effectiveness of adapting to climate \\nchange ( medium conﬁdence ). {6.9}\\nClimate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction require \\ncapacity building and an integrated approach to ensure \\ntrade-offs between short- and long-term gains in dealing \\nwith the uncertainty of increasing extreme events, abrupt changes and cascading impacts at different geographic scales \\n(high\\xa0conﬁdence ). {6.9}\\nLimiting the risk from the impact of extreme events and abrupt \\nchanges leads to successful adaptation to climate change \\nwith the presence of well-coordinated climate-affected sectors and disaster management relevant agencies ( high \\nconﬁdence ). Transformative governance inclusive of successful \\nintegration of disaster risk management (DRM) and climate \\nchange adaptation, empowerment of vulnerable groups, and \\naccountability of governmental decisions promotes climate-resilient development pathways ( high conﬁdence ). {6.9}\\nTS.7  Low-lying Islands and Coasts  \\n(Integrative Cross-Chapter Box)\\nOcean and cryosphere changes already impact Low-Lying \\nIslands and Coasts (LLIC), including Small Island\\xa0Developing \\nStates (SIDS), with cascading and compounding risks.

It \\nfollows the structure of the SRCCL (Figure TS.1) and is presented \\nin seven parts. TS.1 (Chapter 1) provides a synopsis of the main \\nissues addressed in the Special Report, introducing key concepts \\nand definitions and highlighting where the report builds on \\nprevious publications. TS.2 (Chapter 2) focuses on the dynamics of \\nthe land–climate system (Figure TS.2). It assesses recent progress \\ntowards understanding the impacts of climate change on land, and \\nthe feedbacks land has on climate and which arise from altered \\nbiogeochemical and biophysical fluxes between the atmosphere and \\nthe land surface. TS.3 (Chapter 3) examines how the world’s dryland \\npopulations are uniquely vulnerable to desertification and climate \\nchange, but also have significant knowledge in adapting to climate \\nvariability and addressing desertification. TS.4 (Chapter\\xa04) assesses \\nthe urgency of tackling land degradation across all land ecosystems. \\nDespite accelerating trends of land degradation, reversing these \\ntrends is attainable through restoration efforts and improved land \\nmanagement, which is expected to improve resilience to climate \\nchange, mitigate climate change, and ensure food security for \\ngenerations to come. TS.5 (Chapter 5) focuses on food security, \\nwith an assessment of the risks and opportunities that climate \\nchange presents to food systems. It considers how mitigation and \\nadaptation can contribute to both human and planetary health. TS.6 \\n(Chapter 6) introduces options for responding to the challenges of \\ndesertification, land degradation and food security and evaluates the \\ntrade-offs for sustainable land management, climate adaptation and \\nmitigation, and the sustainable development goals. TS.7 (Chapter 7) \\nfurther assesses decision making and policy responses to risks in the \\nclimate-land-human system. TS.1  Framing and context\\nLand, including its water bodies, provides the basis for human \\nlivelihoods and well-being through primary productivity, the \\nsupply of food, freshwater, and multiple other ecosystem \\nservices (high confidence).  Neither our individual or societal \\nidentities, nor the world’s economy would exist without the \\nmultiple resources, services and livelihood systems provided by \\nland ecosystems and biodiversity. The annual value of the world’s \\ntotal terrestrial ecosystem services has been estimated at 75 trillion \\nUSD in 2011, approximately equivalent to the annual global Gross \\nDomestic Product (based on USD2007 values) (medium confidence). \\nLand and its biodiversity also represent essential, intangible benefits \\nto humans, such as cognitive and spiritual enrichment, sense of \\nbelonging and aesthetic and recreational values. Valuing ecosystem \\nservices with monetary methods often overlooks these intangible \\nservices that shape societies, cultures and quality of life and the \\nintrinsic value of biodiversity. The Earth’s land area is finite. Using \\nland resources sustainably is fundamental for human well-being \\n(high confidence).\\xa0{1.1.1}\\nThe current geographic spread of the use of land, the large \\nappropriation of multiple ecosystem services and the loss \\nof biodiversity are unprecedented in human history (high \\nconfidence). By 2015, about three-quarters of the global ice-free land \\nsurface was affected by human use. Humans appropriate one-quarter \\nto one-third of global terrestrial potential net primary production \\n(high confidence). Croplands cover 12–14% of the global ice-free \\nsurface. Since 1961, the supply of global per capita food calories \\nincreased by about one-third, with the consumption of vegetable \\noils and meat more than doubling. At the same time, the use of \\ninorganic nitrogen fertiliser increased by nearly ninefold, and the use \\nof irrigation water roughly doubled (high confidence). Human use, \\nat varying intensities, affects about 60–85% of forests and 70–90% \\nof other natural ecosystems (e.g., savannahs, natural grasslands) \\n(high confidence). Land use caused global biodiversity to decrease by \\naround 11–14% (medium confidence).

The average temperature over land for the period \\n2006–2015 was 1.53°C higher than for the period 1850–1900, and \\n0.66°C larger than the equivalent global mean temperature change. \\nThese warmer temperatures (with changing precipitation patterns) \\nhave altered the start and end of growing seasons, contributed to \\nregional crop yield reductions, reduced freshwater availability, and \\nput biodiversity under further stress and increased tree mortality (high \\nconfidence). Increasing levels of atmospheric CO2, have contributed \\nto observed increases in plant growth as well as to increases in woody \\nplant cover in grasslands and savannahs (medium confidence). {1.1.2}\\nUrgent action to stop and reverse the over-exploitation of \\nland resources would buffer the negative impacts of multiple \\npressures, including climate change, on ecosystems and society \\n(high confidence). Socio-economic drivers of land use change such \\nas technological development, population growth and increasing \\nper capita demand for multiple ecosystem services are projected to \\ncontinue into the future (high confidence). These and other drivers \\ncan amplify existing environmental and societal challenges, such \\nas the conversion of natural ecosystems into managed land, rapid \\nurbanisation, pollution from the intensification of land management \\nand equitable access to land resources (high confidence). Climate \\nchange will add to these challenges through direct, negative impacts \\non ecosystems and the services they provide (high confidence). Acting \\nimmediately and simultaneously on these multiple drivers would \\nenhance food, fibre and water security, alleviate desertification, and \\nreverse land degradation, without compromising the non-material or \\nregulating benefits from land (high confidence). {1.1.2, 1.2.1, 1.3.2–\\n1.3.6, Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1}\\nRapid reductions in anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) \\nemissions that restrict warming to “well-below” 2°C would \\ngreatly reduce the negative impacts of climate change on \\nland ecosystems (high confidence). In the absence of rapid \\nemissions reductions, reliance on large-scale, land-based, \\nclimate change mitigation is projected to increase, which \\nwould aggravate existing pressures on land (high confidence). \\nClimate change mitigation efforts that require large land areas (e.g., \\nbioenergy and afforestation/reforestation) are projected to compete \\nwith existing uses of land (high confidence). The competition for land could increase food prices and lead to further intensification \\n(e.g., fertiliser and water use) with implications for water and air \\npollution, and the further loss of biodiversity (medium confidence). \\nSuch consequences would jeopardise societies’ capacity to achieve \\nmany Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) that depend on land \\n(high confidence). {1.3.1, Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 1}\\nNonetheless, there are many land-related climate change \\nmitigation options that do not increase the competition for \\nland (high confidence). Many of these options have co-benefits \\nfor climate change adaptation (medium confidence).  Land use \\ncontributes about one-quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions, \\nnotably CO2 emissions from deforestation, CH4 emissions from rice \\nand ruminant livestock and N2O emissions from fertiliser use (high \\nconfidence). Land ecosystems also take up large amounts of carbon \\n(high confidence). Many land management options exist to both \\nreduce the magnitude of emissions and enhance carbon uptake. These \\noptions enhance crop productivity, soil nutrient status, microclimate \\nor biodiversity, and thus, support adaptation to climate change (high \\nconfidence). In addition, changes in consumer behaviour, such as \\nreducing the over-consumption of food and energy would benefit the \\nreduction of GHG emissions from land (high confidence). The barriers \\nto the implementation of mitigation and adaptation options include \\nskills deficit, financial and institutional barriers, absence of incentives, \\naccess to relevant technologies, consumer awareness and the limited \\nspatial scale at which the success of these practices and methods \\nhave been demonstrated. {1.2.1, 1.3.2, 1.3.3, 1.3.4, 1.3.5, 1.3.6}\\nSustainable food supply and food consumption, based on \\nnutritionally balanced and diverse diets, would enhance \\nfood security under climate and socio-economic changes \\n(high confidence). Improving food access, utilisation, quality and \\nsafety to enhance nutrition, and promoting globally equitable diets \\ncompatible with lower emissions have demonstrable positive impacts \\non land use and food security (high confidence). Food security is also \\nnegatively affected by food loss and waste (estimated as 25–30% of \\ntotal food produced) (medium confidence). Barriers to improved food \\nsecurity include economic drivers (prices, availability and stability of \\nsupply) and traditional, social and cultural norms around food eating \\npractices. Climate change is expected to increase variability in food \\nproduction and prices globally (high confidence), but the trade in food \\ncommodities can buffer these effects. Trade can provide embodied Figure TS.2 (continued): Panels A-F show the status and trends in selected land use and climate variables that represent many of the core topics covered in this report. \\nThe annual time series in B and D–F are based on the most comprehensive, available data from national statistics, in most cases from FAOSTAT which starts in 1961. \\nY-axes in panels D–F are expressed relative to the starting year of the time series (rebased to zero).

Desertification hotspots, as identified by \\na decline in vegetation productivity between the 1980s and 2000s, \\nextended to about 9.2% of drylands (±0.5%), affecting about 500 \\n(±120) million people in 2015.

Examples of potential limits to adaptation due \\nto climate-change-induced land degradation are coastal erosion \\n(where land disappears, collapsing infrastructure and livelihoods due \\nto thawing of permafrost), and extreme forms of soil erosion. {4.7, \\n4.8.5, 4.8.6, 4.9.6, 4.9.7, 4.9.8} \\nLand degradation is a serious and widespread problem, yet \\nkey uncertainties remain concerning its extent, severity, and \\nlinkages to climate change (very high confidence). Despite \\nthe difficulties of objectively measuring the extent and severity of \\nland degradation, given its complex and value-based characteristics, \\nland degradation represents – along with climate change – one of \\nthe biggest and most urgent challenges for humanity (very high \\nconfidence). The current global extent, severity and rates of land \\ndegradation are not well quantified. There is no single method by \\nwhich land degradation can be measured objectively and consistently \\nover large areas because it is such a complex and value-laden concept \\n(very high confidence). However, many existing scientific and locally \\nbased approaches, including the use of ILK, can assess different \\naspects of land degradation or provide proxies. Remote sensing, \\ncorroborated by other data, can generate geographically explicit and \\nglobally consistent data that can be used as proxies over relevant \\ntime scales (several decades). Few studies have specifically addressed \\nthe impacts of proposed land-based negative emission technologies \\non land degradation. Much research has tried to understand how \\nlivelihoods and ecosystems are affected by a particular stressor – for \\nexample, drought, heat stress, or waterlogging. Important knowledge \\ngaps remain in understanding how plants, habitats and ecosystems \\nare affected by the cumulative and interacting impacts of several \\nstressors, including potential new stressors resulting from large-scale \\nimplementation of negative emission technologies. {4.10}TS.5 Food security \\nThe current food system (production, transport, processing, \\npackaging, storage, retail, consumption, loss and waste) feeds \\nthe great majority of world population and supports the \\nlivelihoods of over 1 billion people. Since 1961, food supply per \\ncapita has increased more than 30%, accompanied by greater use \\nof nitrogen fertilisers (increase of about 800%) and water resources \\nfor irrigation (increase of more than 100%). However, an estimated \\n821 million people are currently undernourished, 151 million children \\nunder five are stunted, 613 million women and girls aged 15 to 49 \\nsuffer from iron deficiency, and 2 billion adults are overweight or \\nobese. The food system is under pressure from non-climate stressors \\n(e.g., population and income growth, demand for animal-sourced \\nproducts), and from climate change. These climate and non-climate \\nstresses are impacting the four pillars of food security (availability, \\naccess, utilisation, and stability). (Figure TS.9) {5.1.1, 5.1.2}\\nObserved climate change is already affecting food security \\nthrough increasing temperatures, changing precipitation \\npatterns, and greater frequency of some extreme events (high \\nconfidence).  Studies that separate out climate change from other \\nfactors affecting crop yields have shown that yields of some crops \\n(e.g., maize and wheat) in many lower-latitude regions have been \\naffected negatively by observed climate changes, while in many \\nhigher-latitude regions, yields of some crops (e.g., maize, wheat, \\nand sugar beets) have been affected positively over recent decades. \\nWarming compounded by drying has caused large negative effects \\non yields in parts of the Mediterranean.  Based on ILK, climate \\nchange is affecting food security in drylands, particularly those in \\nAfrica, and high mountain regions of Asia and South America. (Figure \\nTS.10) {5.2.2}\\nFood security will be increasingly affected by projected future \\nclimate change (high confidence). Across SSPs 1, 2, and 3, global \\ncrop and economic models projected a 1–29% cereal price increase \\nin 2050 due to climate change (RCP 6.0), which would impact \\nconsumers globally through higher food prices; regional effects will \\nvary (high confidence). Low-income consumers are particularly at \\nrisk, with models projecting increases of 1–183 million additional \\npeople at risk of hunger across the SSPs compared to a no climate \\nchange scenario (high confidence). While increased CO2 is projected \\nto be beneficial for crop productivity at lower temperature increases, \\nit is projected to lower nutritional quality (high confidence) (e.g., \\nwheat grown at 546–586 ppm CO2 has 5.9–12.7% less protein, \\n3.7–6.5% less zinc, and 5.2–7.5% less iron). Distributions of pests \\nand diseases will change, affecting production negatively in many \\nregions (high confidence). Given increasing extreme events and \\ninterconnectedness, risks of food system disruptions are growing \\n(high confidence). {5.2.3, 5.2.4}  \\nVulnerability of pastoral systems to climate change is very high \\n(high confidence). Pastoralism is practiced in more than 75% of \\ncountries by between 200 and 500 million people, including nomadic \\ncommunities, transhumant herders, and agropastoralists. Impacts \\nin pastoral systems in Africa include lower pasture and animal \\nproductivity, damaged reproductive function, and biodiversity loss. \\nPastoral system vulnerability is exacerbated by non-climate factors '}\n",

Declines in yields and crop suitability are projected \\nunder higher temperatures, especially in tropical and semi-tropical \\nregions. Heat stress reduces fruit set and speeds up development of \\nannual vegetables, resulting in yield losses, impaired product quality, \\nand increasing food loss and waste. Longer growing seasons enable \\na greater number of plantings to be cultivated and can contribute \\nto greater annual yields. However, some fruits and vegetables need \\na\\xa0 period of cold accumulation to produce a viable harvest, and \\nwarmer winters may constitute a risk. {5.2.2}\\nFood security and climate change have strong gender and \\nequity dimensions (high confidence).

Climate extremes \\nhave immediate and long-term impacts on livelihoods of poor \\nand vulnerable communities, contributing to greater risks of food \\ninsecurity that can be a stress multiplier for internal and external \\nmigration (medium confidence). Empowering women and rights-\\nbased approaches to decision-making can create synergies among \\nhousehold food security, adaptation, and mitigation. {5.2.6, 5.6.4} \\nMany practices can be optimised and scaled up to advance \\nadaptation throughout the food system (high confidence). \\nSupply-side options include increased soil organic matter and \\nerosion control, improved cropland, livestock, grazing land \\nmanagement, and genetic improvements for tolerance to heat and \\ndrought. Diversification in the food system (e.g., implementation \\nof integrated production systems, broad-based genetic resources, \\nand heterogeneous diets) is a key strategy to reduce risks (medium \\nconfidence). Demand-side adaptation, such as adoption of healthy \\nand sustainable diets, in conjunction with reduction in food loss and \\nwaste, can contribute to adaptation through reduction in additional \\nland area needed for food production and associated food system \\nvulnerabilities. ILK can contribute to enhancing food system resilience \\n(high confidence). {5.3, 5.6.3 Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 5}.\\nAbout 21–37% of total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are \\nattributable to the food system. These are from agriculture \\nand land use, storage, transport, packaging, processing, retail, \\nand consumption (medium confidence). This estimate includes \\nemissions of 9–14% from crop and livestock activities within the \\nfarm gate and 5–14% from land use and land-use change including \\ndeforestation and peatland degradation (high confidence); 5–10% \\nis from supply chain activities (medium confidence). This estimate \\nincludes GHG emissions from food loss and waste. Within the food \\nsystem, during the period 2007–2016, the major sources of emissions \\nfrom the supply side were agricultural production, with crop and \\nlivestock activities within the farm gate generating respectively \\n142 ± 42 TgCH4 yr–1 (high confidence) and 8.0 ± 2.5 TgN2O yr–1 \\n(high confidence), and CO2 emissions linked to relevant land-use \\nchange dynamics such as deforestation and peatland degradation, \\ngenerating 4.9 ± 2.5 GtCO2 yr–1. Using 100-year GWP values (no climate feedback) from the IPCC AR5, this implies that total GHG \\nemissions from agriculture were 6.2 ± 1.4 GtCO2-eq yr–1, increasing \\nto 11.1 ± 2.9 GtCO2-eq yr–1 including relevant land use. Without \\nintervention, these are likely to increase by about 30–40% by 2050, \\ndue to increasing demand based on population and income growth \\nand dietary change (high confidence). {5.4} \\nSupply-side practices can contribute to climate change \\nmitigation by reducing crop and livestock emissions, \\nsequestering carbon in soils and biomass, and by decreasing \\nemissions intensity within sustainable production systems \\n(high confidence). Total technical mitigation potential from \\ncrop and livestock activities and agroforestry is estimated as \\n2.3–9.6 GtCO2-eq yr–1 by 2050 (medium confidence). Options with \\nlarge potential for GHG mitigation in cropping systems include soil \\ncarbon sequestration (at decreasing rates over time), reductions \\nin N2O emissions from fertilisers, reductions in CH4 emissions from \\npaddy rice, and bridging of yield gaps. Options with large potential \\nfor mitigation in livestock systems include better grazing land \\nmanagement, with increased net primary production and soil carbon \\nstocks, improved manure management, and higher-quality feed. \\nReductions in GHG emissions intensity (emissions per unit product) \\nfrom livestock can support reductions in absolute emissions, provided \\nappropriate governance to limit total production is implemented at \\nthe same time (medium confidence). {5.5.1} \\nConsumption of healthy and sustainable diets presents major \\nopportunities for reducing GHG emissions from food systems \\nand improving health outcomes (high confidence). Examples of \\nhealthy and sustainable diets are high in coarse grains, pulses, fruits \\nand vegetables, and nuts and seeds; low in energy-intensive animal-\\nsourced and discretionary foods (such as sugary beverages); and \\nwith a carbohydrate threshold. Total technical mitigation potential \\nof dietary changes is estimated as 0.7–8.0 GtCO2-eq yr–1 by 2050 \\n(medium confidence). This estimate includes reductions in emissions \\nfrom livestock and soil carbon sequestration on spared land, but co-\\nbenefits with health are not taken into account. Mitigation potential \\nof dietary change may be higher, but achievement of this potential at \\nbroad scales depends on consumer choices and dietary preferences \\nthat are guided by social, cultural, environmental, and traditional \\nfactors, as well as income growth. Meat analogues such as imitation \\nmeat (from plant products), cultured meat, and insects may help in \\nthe transition to more healthy and sustainable diets, although their \\ncarbon footprints and acceptability are uncertain. {5.5.2, 5.6.5}\\nReduction of food loss and waste could lower GHG emissions \\nand improve food security (medium confidence).

The chapter also discusses \\nimplications for Nature’s Contributions to People (NCP), including \\nbiodiversity and water, and sustainable development, by assessing \\nintersections with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The \\nchapter assesses response options that could be used to address these \\nchallenges. These response options were derived from the previous \\nchapters and fall into three broad categories: land management, \\nvalue chain, and risk management.\\nThe land challenges faced today vary across regions; climate \\nchange will increase challenges in the future, while socio-\\neconomic development could either increase or decrease \\nchallenges (high confidence). Increases in biophysical impacts from \\nclimate change can worsen desertification, land degradation, and \\nfood insecurity (high confidence). Additional pressures from socio-\\neconomic development could further exacerbate these challenges; \\nhowever, the effects are scenario dependent. Scenarios with increases \\nin income and reduced pressures on land can lead to reductions in \\nfood insecurity; however, all assessed scenarios result in increases in \\nwater demand and water scarcity (medium confidence).\\xa0{6.1} \\nThe applicability and efficacy of response options are \\nregion and context specific; while many value chain and risk \\nmanagement options are potentially broadly applicable, many \\nland management options are applicable on less than 50% of \\nthe ice-free land surface (high confidence).

Some response options produce adverse \\nside effects only in certain regions or contexts; for example, response \\noptions that use freshwater may have no adverse side effects in \\nregions where water is plentiful, but large adverse side effects in \\nregions where water is scarce (high confidence). Response options \\nwith biophysical climate effects (e.g., afforestation, reforestation) \\nmay have different effects on local climate, depending on where they \\nare implemented (medium confidence).

There are a \\nvariety of response options available at different scales that could \\nform portfolios of measures applied by different stakeholders – from \\nfarm to international scales. For example, agricultural diversification \\nand use of local seeds by smallholders can be particularly useful \\npoverty eradication and biodiversity conservation measures, but are \\nonly successful when higher scales, such as national and international \\nmarkets and supply chains, also value these goods in trade regimes, \\nand consumers see the benefits of purchasing these goods. However, \\nthe land and food sectors face particular challenges of institutional \\nfragmentation, and often suffer from a lack of engagement between \\nstakeholders at different scales (medium confidence). {6.3, 6.4}\\nDelayed action will result in an increased need for response \\nto land challenges and a decreased potential for land-based \\nresponse options due to climate change and other pressures \\n(high confidence). For example, failure to mitigate climate change \\nwill increase requirements for adaptation and may reduce the efficacy \\nof future land-based mitigation options (high confidence). The \\npotential for some land management options decreases as climate \\nchange increases; for example, climate alters the sink capacity for \\nsoil and vegetation carbon sequestration, reducing the potential \\nfor increased soil organic carbon (high confidence). Other options \\n(e.g., reduced deforestation and forest degradation) prevent further \\ndetrimental effects to the land surface; delaying these options could \\nlead to increased deforestation, conversion, or degradation, serving \\nas increased sources of GHGs and having concomitant negative \\nimpacts on NCPs (medium confidence).

Studies linking bioenergy to food security estimate an increase in the population at risk of hunger to up to 150 million people at this level\\nof implementation {6.3.5}. The red hatched cells for desertification and land degradation indicate that while up to 15 million km2 of additional land is required in 2100\\nin 2°C scenarios which will increase pressure for desertification and land degradation, the actual area aﬀected by this additional pressure is not easily quantified\\n{6.3.3; 6.3.4}. \\nBest practice: The sign and magnitude of the eﬀects of bioenergy and BECCS depends on the scale of deployment, the type of bioenergy feedstock, which other \\nresponse options are included, and where bioenergy is grown (including prior land use and indirect land use change emissions). For example, limiting bioenergy \\nproduction to marginal lands or abandoned cropland would have negligible eﬀects on biodiversity, food security, and potentially co-benefits for land degradation; \\nhowever, the benefits for mitigation could also be smaller. {Table 6.58}\\nMitigation Adaptation Desertification Land degradation Food security Cost\\nMitigation Adaptation Desertification Land degradation Food securityReforestation and forest restoration\\nHigh level: Impacts on adaptation, desertification, land degradation and food security are maximum potential impacts assuming implementation of reforestation \\nand forest restoration (partly overlapping with aﬀorestation) at a scale of 10.1 GtCO/two.dnom yr–1 removal {6.3.1}.

Response options implemented differently at local to global scales could lead to different outcomes. Magnitude \\nof potential:  For panel A, magnitudes are for the technical potential of response options globally. For each land challenge, magnitudes are set relative to a marker \\nlevel as follows. For mitigation, potentials are set relative to the approximate potentials for the response options with the largest individual impacts (~3 GtCO2-eq yr–1). \\nThe threshold for the ‘large’ magnitude category is set at this level. For adaptation, magnitudes are set relative to the 100 million lives estimated to be affected by \\nclimate change and a carbon-based economy between 2010 and 2030. The threshold for the ‘large’ magnitude category represents 25% of this total. For desertification \\nand land degradation, magnitudes are set relative to the lower end of current estimates of degraded land, 10–60 million km2. The threshold for the ‘large’ magnitude \\ncategory represents 30% of the lower estimate. For food security, magnitudes are set relative to the approximately 800 million people who are currently undernourished. \\nThe\\xa0threshold for the ‘large’ magnitude category represents 12.5% of this total. For panel B, for the first row (high level implementation) for each response option, the \\nmagnitude and thresholds are as defined for panel A. In the second row (best practice implementation) for each response option, the qualitative assessments that are \\ngreen denote potential positive impacts, and those shown in grey indicate neutral interactions. Increased food production is assumed to be achieved through sustainable \\nintensification rather than through injudicious application of additional external inputs such as agrochemicals. Levels of confidence: Confidence in the magnitude \\ncategory (high, medium or low) into which each option falls for mitigation, adaptation, combating desertification and land degradation, and enhancing food security. \\nHigh confidence means that there is a high level of agreement and evidence in the literature to support the categorisation as high, medium or low magnitude. Low \\nconfidence denotes that the categorisation of magnitude is based on few studies. Medium confidence reflects medium evidence and agreement in the magnitude \\nof response. Cost ranges: Cost estimates are based on aggregation of often regional studies and vary in the components of costs that are included. In panel\\xa0B, \\ncost estimates are not provided for best practice implementation. One coin indicates low cost (<USD10 tCO2-eq–1 or <USD20 ha–1), two coins indicate medium cost \\n(USD10–USD100 tCO2-eq–1 or USD20–USD200 ha–1), and three coins indicate high cost (>USD100 tCO2-eq–1 or USD200\\xa0ha–1). Thresholds in USD ha–1 are chosen to be \\ncomparable, but precise conversions will depend on the response option. Supporting evidence: Supporting evidence for the magnitude of the quantitative potential for \\nland management-based response options can be found as follows: for mitigation Tables 6.13 to 6.20, with further evidence in Section 2.7.1; for adaptation Tables 6.21 \\nto 6.28; for combating desertification Tables 6.29 to 6.36, with further evidence in Chapter 3; for combating degradation tables 6.37 to 6.44, with further evidence in \\nChapter 4; for enhancing food security Table’s 6.45 to 6.52, with further evidence in Chapter 5. Other synergies and trade-offs not shown here are discussed in Chapter\\xa06. \\nAdditional supporting evidence for the qualitative assessments in the second row for each option in panel B can be found in the Table’s 6.6, 6.55, 6.56 and 6.58, Section \\n6.3.5.1.3, and Box 6.1c.'}\n",

SSP1 is characterized by low population growth, reduced inequalities, \\nland-use regulation, low meat consumption, increased trade and \\nfew barriers to adaptation or mitigation. SSP3 has the opposite \\ncharacteristics. Under SSP1, only a small fraction of the dryland \\npopulation (around 3% at 3°C for the year 2050) will be exposed \\nand vulnerable to water stress. However under SSP3, around 20% \\nof dryland populations (for the year 2050) will be exposed and \\nvulnerable to water stress by 1.5°C and 24% by 3°C.

            "{'document': 'land.pdf', 'page': 35, 'content': '70\\nTechnical Summary\\nTSFigure TS.14 (continued): As in previous IPCC reports the literature was used to make expert judgements to assess the levels of global warming at which levels of \\nrisk are undetectable, moderate, high or very high, as described further in Chapter 7 and other parts of the underlying report. The figure indicates assessed risks at \\napproximate warming levels which may be influenced by a variety of factors, including adaptation responses. The assessment considers adaptive capacity consistent \\nwith the SSP pathways as described below. Panel A: Risks to selected elements of the land system as a function of global mean surface temperature {2.1; Box 2.1; 3.5; \\n3.7.1.1; 4.4.1.1; 4.4.1.2; 4.4.1.3; 5.2.2; 5.2.3; 5.2.4; 5.2.5; 7.2;7.3, Table SM7.1}. Links to broader systems are illustrative and not intended to be comprehensive. Risk \\nlevels are estimated assuming medium exposure and vulnerability driven by moderate trends in socioeconomic conditions broadly consistent with an SSP2 pathway. \\n{Table SM7.4}. Panel B: Risks associated with desertification, land degradation and food security due to climate change and patterns of socio-economic development. \\nIncreasing risks associated with desertification include population exposed and vulnerable to water scarcity in drylands. Risks related to land degradation include \\nincreased habitat degradation, population exposed to wildfire and floods and costs of floods. Risks to food security include availability and access to food, including \\npopulation at risk of hunger, food price increases and increases in disability adjusted life years attributable due to childhood underweight. Risks are assessed for two \\ncontrasted socio-economic pathways (SSP1 and SSP3 {SPM Box 1}) excluding the effects of targeted mitigation policies {3.5; 4.2.1.2; 5.2.2; 5.2.3; 5.2.4; 5.2.5; 6.1.4; 7.2, \\nTable SM7.5}. Risks are not indicated beyond 3°C because SSP1 does not exceed this level of temperature change. All panels: As part of the assessment, literature was \\ncompiled and data extracted into a summary table. A formal expert elicitation protocol (based on modified-Delphi technique and the Sheffield Elicitation Framework), \\nwas followed to identify risk transition thresholds. This included a multi-round elicitation process with two rounds of independent anonymous threshold judgement, and \\na final consensus discussion. Further information on methods and underlying literature can be found in Chapter 7 Supplementary Material.\\nParticipation of people in land and climate decision making \\nand policy formation allows for transparent effective solutions \\nand the implementation of response options that advance \\nsynergies, reduce trade-offs in sustainable land management \\n(high confidence), and overcomes barriers to adaptation and \\nmitigation (high confidence). Improvements to sustainable land \\nmanagement are achieved by: (1) engaging people in citizen science \\nby mediating and facilitating landscape conservation planning, policy \\nchoice, and early warning systems (medium confidence); (2) involving \\npeople in identifying problems (including species decline, habitat \\nloss, land use change in agriculture, food production and forestry), \\nselection of indicators, collection of climate data, land modelling, \\nagricultural innovation opportunities. When social learning is \\ncombined with collective action, transformative change can occur \\naddressing tenure issues and changing land use practices (medium \\nconfidence). Meaningful participation overcomes barriers by opening \\nup policy and science surrounding climate and land decisions to \\ninclusive discussion that promotes alternatives. {3.8.5, 7.5.1, 7.5.9; \\n7.6.1, 7.6.4, 7.6.5, 7.6.7, 7.7.4, 7.7.6} \\nEmpowering women can bolster synergies among household \\nfood security and sustainable land management (high \\nconfidence). This can be achieved with policy instruments that \\naccount for gender differences. The overwhelming presence of \\nwomen in many land-based activities including agriculture provides \\nopportunities to mainstream gender policies, overcome gender \\nbarriers, enhance gender equality, and increase sustainable land \\nmanagement and food security (high confidence). Policies that \\naddress barriers include gender qualifying criteria and gender \\nappropriate delivery, including access to financing, information, \\ntechnology, government transfers, training, and extension may be \\nbuilt into existing women’s programs, structures (civil society groups) \\nincluding collective micro enterprise (medium confidence). {Cross-\\nChapter Box 11 in Chapter 7} \\nThe significant social and political changes required for \\nsustainable land use, reductions in demand and land-based \\nmitigation efforts associated with climate stabilisation require \\na wide range of governance mechanisms. The expansion and \\ndiversification of land use and biomass systems and markets requires hybrid governance: public-private partnerships, transnational, \\npolycentric, and state governance to insure opportunities are \\nmaximised, trade-offs are managed equitably, and negative impacts \\nare minimised (medium confidence). {7.5.6, 7.7.2, 7.7.3, Cross-\\nChapter Box 7 in Chapter 6} \\nLand tenure systems have implications for both adaptation \\nand mitigation, which need to be understood within specific \\nsocio-economic and legal contexts, and may themselves \\nbe impacted by climate change and climate action (limited \\nevidence, high agreement). Land policy (in a diversity of forms \\nbeyond focus on freehold title) can provide routes to land security \\nand facilitate or constrain climate action, across cropping, rangeland, \\nforest, fresh-water ecosystems and other systems.  Large-scale land \\nacquisitions are an important context for the relations between \\ntenure security and climate change, but their scale, nature and \\nimplications are imperfectly understood. There is medium confidence \\nthat land titling and recognition programs, particularly those that \\nauthorise and respect indigenous and communal tenure, can lead \\nto improved management of forests, including for carbon storage. \\nStrong public coordination (government and public administration) \\ncan integrate land policy with national policies on adaptation and \\nreduce sensitivities to climate change. {7.7.2; 7.7.3; 7.7.4, 7.7.5}  \\nSignificant gaps in knowledge exist when it comes to \\nunderstanding the effectiveness of policy instruments and \\ninstitutions related to land use management, forestry, \\nagriculture and bioenergy. Interdisciplinary research is needed \\non the impacts of policies and measures in land sectors. Knowledge \\ngaps are due in part to the highly contextual and local nature of \\nland and climate measures and the long time periods needed to \\nevaluate land use change in its socio-economic frame, as compared \\nto technological investments in energy or industry that are somewhat \\nmore comparable. Significant investment is needed in monitoring, \\nevaluation and assessment of policy impacts across different sectors \\nand levels. {7.8}'}\n",

The SSPs span a range \\nof different socioeconomic assumptions (Box SPM.1).   They are combined with Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs)2 which imply different levels of mitigation. \\nThe changes in cropland, pasture, bioenergy cropland, forest, and natural land from 2010 are shown. For this Figure, Cropland includes all land in food, feed, and fodder \\ncrops, as well as other arable land (cultivated area). This category includes first generation non-forest bioenergy crops (e.g., corn for ethanol, sugar cane for ethanol, \\nsoybeans for biodiesel), but excludes second generation bioenergy crops. Pasture includes categories of pasture land, not only high-quality rangeland, and is based on \\nFAO definition of ‘permanent meadows and pastures’. Bioenergy cropland includes land dedicated to second generation energy crops (e.g.,\\xa0switchgrass, miscanthus, \\nfast-growing wood species). Forest includes managed and unmanaged forest. Natural land includes other grassland, savannah, and shrubland. Panel A: This panel shows \\nintegrated assessment model (IAM)3  results for SSP1, SSP2 and SSP5 at RCP1.9.4 For each pathway, the shaded areas show the range across all IAMs; the line indicates \\nthe median across models. For RCP1.9, SSP1, SSP2 and SSP5 results are from five, four and two IAMs respectively.

            "{'document': '6th_report.pdf', 'page': 6, 'content': 'v\\nForewordForeword\\nThis Synthesis Report (SYR) concludes the Sixth Assessment Report \\n(AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). \\nThe SYR synthesizes and integrates materials contained within the \\nthree Working Groups Assessment Reports and the Special Reports \\ncontributing to the AR6. It addresses a broad range of policy-relevant \\nbut policy-neutral questions approved by the Panel. \\nThe SYR is the synthesis of the most comprehensive assessment of \\nclimate change undertaken thus far by the IPCC: Climate Change 2021: \\nThe Physical Science Basis; Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation \\nand Vulnerability; and Climate Change 2022: Mitigation of Climate \\nChange. The SYR also draws on the findings of three Special Reports \\ncompleted as part of the Sixth Assessment – Global Warming of 1.5°C \\n(2018): an IPCC Special Report on the impacts of global warming of \\n1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas \\nemission pathways, in the context of strengthening the global response \\nto the threat of climate change, sustainable development, and efforts \\nto eradicate poverty (SR1.5); Climate Change and Land (2019): an IPCC \\nSpecial Report on climate change, desertification, land degradation, \\nsustainable land management, food security, and greenhouse gas \\nfluxes in terrestrial ecosystems (SRCCL); and The Ocean and Cryosphere \\nin a Changing Climate (2019) (SROCC).\\nThe AR6 SYR confirms that unsustainable and unequal energy and land use \\nas well as more than a century of burning fossil fuels have unequivocally \\ncaused global warming, with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C \\nabove 1850–1900 in 2011–2020. This has led to widespread adverse \\nimpacts and related losses and damages to nature and people. The \\nnationally determined contributions (NDCs) committed by 2030 show the \\ntemperature will increase by 1.5°C in the first half of the 2030s, and will \\nmake it very difficult to control temperature increase by 2.0°C towards \\nthe end of 21st century. Every increment of global warming will intensify \\nmultiple and concurrent hazards in all regions of the world.\\nThe report points out that limiting human-caused global warming \\nrequires net zero CO 2 emissions. Deep, rapid, and sustained mitigation \\nand accelerated implementation of adaptation actions in this decade \\nwould reduce projected losses and damages for humans and ecosystems \\nand deliver many co-benefits, especially for air quality and health. \\nDelayed mitigation and adaptation action would lock-in high-emissions \\ninfrastructure, raise risks of stranded assets and cost-escalation, reduce \\nfeasibility, and increase losses and damages. Near-term actions involve \\nhigh up-front investments and potentially disruptive changes that can \\nbe lessened by a range of enabling policies. \\nAs an intergovernmental body jointly established  in  1988  by \\nthe World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United \\nNations Environment Programme (UNEP), the IPCC has provided \\npolicymakers with the most authoritative and objective scientific \\nand technical assessments in this field. Beginning in 1990, this \\nseries of IPCC Assessment Reports, Special Reports, Technical Papers, \\nMethodology Reports, and other products have become standard \\nworks of reference. The SYR was made possible thanks to the voluntary work, dedication \\nand commitment of thousands of experts and scientists from around \\nthe globe, representing a range of views and disciplines. We would like \\nto express our deep gratitude to all the members of the Core Writing \\nTeam of the SYR, members of the Extended Writing Team, Contributing \\nAuthors, and the Review Editors, all of whom enthusiastically took on \\nthe huge challenge of producing an outstanding SYR on top of the other \\ntasks they had already committed to during the AR6 cycle. We would \\nalso like to thank the staff of the Technical Support Unit of the SYR and \\nthe IPCC Secretariat for their dedication in organizing the production of \\nthis IPCC report. \\nWe also wish to acknowledge and thank the governments of the IPCC \\nmember countries for their support of scientists in developing this \\nreport, and for their contributions to the IPCC Trust Fund to provide the \\nessentials for participation of experts from developing countries and \\ncountries with economies in transition. We would like to express our \\nappreciation to the government of Singapore for hosting the Scoping \\nMeeting of the SYR, to the government of Ireland for hosting the third \\nCore Writing Team meeting of the SYR, and to the government of \\nSwitzerland for hosting the 58th Session of the IPCC where the SYR \\nwas approved. The generous financial support from the government of \\nthe Republic of Korea enabled the smooth operation of the Technical \\nSupport Unit of the SYR.

It summarizes the state of knowledge of \\nclimate change, its widespread impacts and risks, and climate change \\nmitigation and adaptation, based on the peer-reviewed scientific, \\ntechnical, and socio-economic literature since the publication of the \\nIPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) in 2014. \\nThis SYR distills, synthesizes, and integrates the key findings of the \\nthree Working Group contributions – Climate Change 2021: The \\nPhysical Science Basis; Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and \\nVulnerability; and Climate Change 2022: Mitigation of Climate Change. \\nThe SYR also draws on the findings of three Special Reports completed \\nas part of the Sixth Assessment –  Global Warming of 1.5°C (2018): \\nan IPCC Special Report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5°C \\nabove pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission \\npathways, in the context of strengthening the global response to the \\nthreat of climate change, sustainable development, and efforts to \\neradicate poverty (SR1.5); Climate Change and Land (2019): an IPCC \\nSpecial Report on climate change, desertification, land degradation, \\nsustainable land management, food security, and greenhouse gas fluxes \\nin terrestrial ecosystems (SRCCL); and The Ocean and Cryosphere in a \\nChanging Climate (2019) (SROCC). The SYR, therefore, is a comprehensive, \\ntimely compilation of assessments of the most recent scientific, technical, \\nand socio-economic literature dealing with climate change.\\nScope of the report\\nThe SYR is a self-contained synthesis of the most policy-relevant \\nmaterial drawn from the scientific, technical, and socio-economic \\nliterature assessed during the Sixth Assessment. This report integrates \\nthe main findings of the AR6 Working Group reports and the three \\nAR6 Special Reports. It recognizes the interdependence of climate, \\necosystems and biodiversity, and human societies; the value of \\ndiverse forms of knowledge; and the close linkages between climate \\nadaptation, mitigation, ecosystem health, human well-being, and \\nsustainable development. Building on multiple analytical frameworks, \\nincluding those from the physical and social sciences, this report \\nidentifies opportunities for transformative action which are effective, \\nfeasible, just and equitable systems transitions, and climate resilient \\ndevelopment pathways. Different regional classification schemes are \\nused for physical, social and economic aspects, reflecting the underlying \\nliterature.  \\nThe Synthesis Report emphasizes near-term risks and options for \\naddressing them to give policymakers a sense of the urgency required \\nto address global climate change. The report also provides important \\ninsights about how climate risks interact with not only one another \\nbut non- climate-related risks. It describes the interaction between \\nmitigation and adaptation and how this combination can better confront the climate challenge as well as produce valuable co-benefits. It \\nhighlights the strong connection between equity and climate action and \\nwhy more equitable solutions are vital to addressing climate change. It \\nalso emphasizes how growing urbanization provides an opportunity for \\nambitious climate action to advance climate resilient development and \\nsustainable development for all. And it underscores how restoring and \\nprotecting land and ocean ecosystems can bring multiple benefits to \\nbiodiversity and other societal goals, just as a failure to do so presents \\na major risk to ensuring a healthy planet. \\nStructure\\nThe SYR comprises a Summary for Policymakers (SPM) and a longer report \\nfrom which the SPM is derived, as well as annexes. \\nTo facilitate access to the findings of the SYR for a wide readership, each \\npart of the SPM carries highlighted headline statements. Taken together, \\nthese 18 headline statements provide an overarching summary in \\nsimple, non-technical language for easy assimilation by readers from \\ndifferent walks of life. \\nThe SPM follows a structure and sequence like that in the longer report, \\nbut some issues covered in more than one section of the longer report \\nare summarized in a single location in the SPM. Each paragraph of the \\nSPM contains references to the supporting text in the longer report. \\nIn turn, the longer report contains extensive references to relevant \\nportions of the Working Group Reports or Special Reports mentioned \\nabove. \\nThe longer report is structured around three topic headings as \\nmandated by the Panel. A brief Introduction (Section1) is followed by \\nthree sections. \\nSection 2, ‘Current Status and Trends’, opens with the assessment of \\nobservational evidence for our changing climate, historical and current \\ndrivers of human-induced climate change, and its impacts. It assesses the \\ncurrent implementation of adaptation and mitigation response options. \\nSection 3, ‘Long-Term Climate and Development Futures’, provides an \\nassessment of climate change to 2100 and beyond in a broad range of \\nsocio-economic futures. It considers long-term impacts, risks and costs \\nin adaptation and mitigation pathways in the context of sustainable \\ndevelopment. Section 4, ‘Near-Term Responses in a Changing Climate’, \\nassesses opportunities for scaling up effective action in the period to \\n2040, in the context of climate pledges, and commitments, and the \\npursuit of sustainable development.\\nAnnexes containing a glossary of terms used, list of acronyms, authors, \\nReview Editors, the SYR Scientific Steering Committee, and Expert \\nReviewers complete the report.

A total of 30 CWT members and \\n9 Review Editors were selected and accepted by the IPCC Bureau at its \\n58th Session on 19 May 2020. In the process of developing the SYR, \\n7 Extended Writing Team (EWT) authors were selected by the CWT and \\napproved by the Chair and the IPCC Bureau, and 28 Contributing Authors \\nwere selected by the CWT with the approval of the Chair. These \\nadditional authors were to enhance and deepen the expertise required \\nfor the preparation of the Report. The Chair established at the 58th \\nSession of the Bureau an SYR Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) with a \\nmandate to advise the development of the SYR. The SYR SSC comprised \\nthe members of the IPCC Bureau, excluding those members who served \\nas Review Editors for the SYR.\\nDue to the covid pandemic, the first two meetings of the CWT were held \\nvirtually from 25 to 29 January 2021 and from 16 to 20 August 2021. \\nThe First Order Draft (FOD) was released to experts and governments \\nfor review on 10 January 2022 with comments due on 20 March 2022. \\nThe CWT met in Dublin from 25 to 28 March 2022 to discuss how \\nbest to revise the FOD to address the more than 10,000 comments \\nreceived.

The summary \\nfor Policymakers (SPM) is structured in three parts: SPM.A Current Status and Trends, SPM.B Future Climate Change, Risks, and \\nLong-Term Responses, and SPM.C Responses in the Near Term3. \\nThis report recognizes the interdependence of climate, ecosystems and biodiversity, and human societies; the value of diverse \\nforms of knowledge; and the close linkages between climate change adaptation, mitigation, ecosystem health, human well-being \\nand sustainable development, and reflects the increasing diversity of actors involved in climate action. \\nBased on scientific understanding, key findings can be formulated as statements of fact or associated with an assessed level of \\nconfidence using the IPCC calibrated language4. \\xa0\\n1 The three Working Group contributions to AR6 are: AR6 Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis; AR6 Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation \\nand Vulnerability; and AR6 Climate Change 2022: Mitigation of Climate Change. Their assessments cover scientific literature accepted for publication \\nrespectively by 31 January 2021, 1 September 2021 and 11 October 2021.\\n2 The three Special Reports are: Global Warming of 1.5°C (2018): an IPCC Special Report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial \\nlevels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways, in the context of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change, sustainable \\ndevelopment, and efforts to eradicate poverty (SR1.5); Climate Change and Land (2019): an IPCC Special Report on climate change, desertification, land \\ndegradation, sustainable land management, food security, and greenhouse gas fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems (SRCCL); and The Ocean and Cryosphere in \\na Changing Climate (2019) (SROCC). The Special Reports cover scientific literature accepted for publication respectively by 15 May 2018, 7 April 2019 and \\n15 May 2019.\\n3 In this report, the near term is defined as the period until 2040. The long term is defined as the period beyond 2040.\\n4 Each finding is grounded in an evaluation of underlying evidence and agreement. The IPCC calibrated language uses five qualifiers to express a level of \\nconfidence: very low, low, medium, high and very high, and typeset in italics, for example, medium confidence . The following terms are used to indicate the \\nassessed likelihood of an outcome or a result: virtually certain 99–100% probability, very likely 90–100%, likely 66–100%, more likely than not >50–100%, \\nabout as likely as not 33–66%, unlikely 0–33%, very unlikely 0–10%, exceptionally unlikely 0–1%. Additional terms (extremely likely 95–100%; and \\nextremely unlikely 0–5%) are also used when appropriate. Assessed likelihood is typeset in italics, e.g., very likely .

Current Status and Trends\\nObserved Warming and its Causes\\nA.1 Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally \\ncaused global warming, with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C above 1850–1900 \\nin 2011–2020. Global greenhouse gas emissions have continued to increase, with unequal \\nhistorical and ongoing contributions arising from unsustainable energy use, land use and \\nland-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production across regions, \\nbetween and within countries, and among individuals ( high confidence ). {2.1, Figure 2.1, \\nFigure 2.2 }\\nA.1.1 Global surface temperature was 1.09 [0.95 to 1.20]°C5 higher in 2011–2020 than 1850–19006, with larger increases \\nover land (1.59 [1.34 to 1.83]°C) than over the ocean (0.88 [0.68 to 1.01]°C). Global surface temperature in the first two \\ndecades of the 21st century (2001–2020) was 0.99 [0.84 to 1.10]°C higher than 1850–1900. Global surface temperature \\nhas increased faster since 1970 than in any other 50-year period over at least the last 2000 years ( high confidence ). \\n{2.1.1, Figure 2.1 }\\nA.1.2  The likely  range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase from 1850–1900 to 2010–20197 is 0.8°C to \\n1.3°C, with a best estimate of 1.07°C. Over this period, it is likely  that well-mixed greenhouse gases (GHGs) contributed \\na warming of 1.0°C to 2.0°C8, and other human drivers (principally aerosols) contributed a cooling of 0.0°C to 0.8°C, \\nnatural (solar and volcanic) drivers changed global surface temperature by –0.1°C to +0.1°C, and internal variability \\nchanged it by –0.2°C to +0.2°C.  {2.1.1, Figure 2.1 }\\nA.1.3 Observed increases in well-mixed GHG concentrations since around 1750 are unequivocally caused by GHG emissions \\nfrom human activities over this period. Historical cumulative net CO 2 emissions from 1850 to 2019 were 2400 ± 240 GtCO 2 \\nof which more than half (58%) occurred between 1850 and 1989, and about 42% occurred between 1990 and 2019 ( high \\nconfidence ). In 2019, atmospheric CO 2 concentrations (410 parts per million) were higher than at any time in at least 2 \\nmillion years ( high confidence ), and concentrations of methane (1866 parts per billion) and nitrous oxide (332 parts per \\nbillion) were higher than at any time in at least 800,000 years ( very high confidence ). {2.1.1, Figure 2.1 }\\nA.1.4  Global net anthropogenic GHG emissions have been estimated to be 59 ± 6.6 GtCO 2-eq9 in 2019, about 12% (6.5 GtCO 2-eq) \\nhigher than in 2010 and 54% (21 GtCO 2-eq) higher than in 1990, with the largest share and growth in gross GHG emissions \\noccurring in CO 2 from fossil fuels combustion and industrial processes (CO 2-FFI) followed by methane, whereas the highest \\nrelative growth occurred in fluorinated gases (F-gases), starting from low levels in 1990. Average annual GHG emissions \\nduring 2010–2019 were higher than in any previous decade on record, while the rate of growth between 2010 and \\n2019 (1.3% yr-1) was lower than that between 2000 and 2009 (2.1% yr-1). In 2019, approximately 79% of global GHG \\n5 Ranges given throughout the SPM represent very likely  ranges (5–95% range) unless otherwise stated.\\n6 The estimated increase in global surface temperature since AR5 is principally due to further warming since 2003–2012 (0.19 [0.16 to 0.22]°C). Additionally, \\nmethodological advances and new datasets have provided a more complete spatial representation of changes in surface temperature, including in the \\nArctic. These and other improvements have also increased the estimate of global surface temperature change by approximately 0.1°C, but this increase \\ndoes not represent additional physical warming since AR5.\\n7 The period distinction with A.1.1 arises because the attribution studies consider this slightly earlier period. The observed warming to 2010–2019 \\nis 1.06 [0.88 to 1.21]°C.\\n8 Contributions from emissions to the 2010–2019 warming relative to 1850–1900 assessed from radiative forcing studies are: CO 2 0.8 [0.5 to 1.2] °C; \\nmethane 0.5 [0.3 to 0.8]°C; nitrous oxide 0.1 [0.0 to 0.2]°C and fluorinated gases 0.1 [0.0 to 0.2]°C. {2.1.1 }\\n9 GHG emission metrics are used to express emissions of different greenhouse gases in a common unit. Aggregated GHG emissions in this report are stated in CO 2-\\nequivalents (CO 2-eq) using the Global Warming Potential with a time horizon of 100 years (GWP100) with values based on the contribution of Working Group I to \\nthe AR6. The AR6 WGI and WGIII reports contain updated emission metric values, evaluations of different metrics with regard to mitigation objectives, and \\nassess new approaches to aggregating gases. The choice of metric depends on the purpose of the analysis and all GHG emission metrics have limitations \\nand uncertainties, given that they simplify the complexity of the physical climate system and its response to past and future GHG emissions.  {2.1.1 }'}\n",

There are widening disparities between the estimated costs \\nof adaptation and the finance allocated to adaptation  (high confidence ). Adaptation finance has come predominantly \\nfrom public sources, and a small proportion of global tracked climate finance was targeted to adaptation and an \\noverwhelming majority to mitigation  (very high confidence ). Although global tracked climate finance has shown \\nan upward trend since AR5, current global financial flows for adaptation, including from public and private finance \\nsources, are insufficient and constrain implementation of adaptation options, especially in developing countries ( high \\nconfidence ).  Adverse climate impacts can reduce the availability of financial resources by incurring losses and damages \\nand through impeding national economic growth, thereby further increasing financial constraints for adaptation, \\nparticularly for developing and least developed countries ( medium confidence ). {2.3.2, 2.3.3 }\\nBox SPM.1 The use of scenarios and modelled pathways in the AR6 Synthesis Report\\nModelled scenarios and pathways19 are used to explore future emissions, climate  change, related impacts and risks, and \\npossible mitigation and adaptation strategies and are based on a range of assumptions, including socio-economic variables \\nand mitigation options. These are quantitative projections and are neither predictions nor forecasts. Global modelled emission \\npathways, including those based on cost effective approaches contain regionally differentiated assumptions and outcomes, \\nand have to be assessed with the careful recognition of these assumptions. Most do not make explicit assumptions about \\nglobal equity, environmental justice or intra-regional income distribution. IPCC is neutral with regard to the assumptions \\nunderlying the scenarios in the literature assessed in this report, which do not cover all possible futures.20 {Cross-Section Box.2 }\\nWGI assessed the climate  response to five illustrative scenarios based on Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs)21 that \\ncover the range of possible future development of anthropogenic drivers of climate  change found in the literature. High and \\nvery high GHG emissions scenarios (SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.522) have CO 2 emissions that roughly double from current levels \\nby 2100 and 2050, respectively. The intermediate GHG emissions scenario (SSP2-4.5) has CO 2 emissions remaining around \\ncurrent levels until the middle of the century. The very low and low GHG emissions scenarios (SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6) have CO 2 \\nemissions declining to net zero around 2050 and 2070, respectively, followed by varying levels of net negative CO 2 emissions. \\nIn addition, Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs)23 were used by WGI and WGII to assess regional climate changes, \\nimpacts and risks. In WGIII, a large number of global modelled emissions pathways were assessed, of which 1202 pathways \\nwere categorised based on their assessed global warming over the 21st century; categories range from pathways that limit \\nwarming to 1.5°C with more than 50% likelihood (noted >50% in this report) with no or limited overshoot (C1) to pathways \\nthat exceed 4°C (C8).  {Cross-Section Box.2 } (Box SPM.1, Table 1 )\\nGlobal warming levels (GWLs) relative to 1850–1900 are used to integrate the assessment of climate change and related \\nimpacts and risks since patterns of changes for many variables at a given GWL are common to all scenarios considered and \\nindependent of timing when that level is reached. { Cross-Section Box.2 }\\n19 In the literature, the terms pathways and scenarios are used interchangeably, with the former more frequently used in relation to climate goals. WGI \\nprimarily used the term scenarios and WGIII mostly used the term modelled emission and mitigation pathways. The SYR primarily uses scenarios when \\nreferring to WGI and modelled emission and mitigation pathways when referring to WGIII.\\n20 Around half of all modelled global emission pathways assume cost- effective approaches that rely on least-cost mitigation/abatement options globally. The \\nother half looks at existing policies and regionally and sectorally differentiated actions.\\n21 SSP-based scenarios are referred to as SSPx-y, where ‘SSPx’ refers to the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway describing the socioeconomic trends underlying the \\nscenarios, and ‘y’ refers to the level of radiative forcing (in watts per square metre, or W m-2) resulting from the scenario in the year 2100.  {Cross-Section Box.2 }\\n22 Very high emissions scenarios have become less likely  but cannot be ruled out. Warming levels >4°C may result from very high emissions scenarios, but can \\nalso occur from lower emission scenarios if climate sensitivity or carbon cycle feedbacks are higher than the best estimate. {3.1.1 }\\n23 RCP-based scenarios are referred to as RCPy, where ‘y’ refers to the level of radiative forcing (in watts per square metre, or W m-2) resulting from the \\nscenario in the year 2100. The SSP scenarios cover a broader range of greenhouse gas and air pollutant futures than the RCPs. They are similar but not \\nidentical, with differences in concentration trajectories.

The assessed \\nclimate response to GHG emissions scenarios results in a best estimate of warming for 2081–2100 that spans a range \\nfrom 1.4°C for a very low GHG emissions scenario (SSP1-1.9) to 2.7°C for an intermediate GHG emissions scenario \\n(SSP2-4.5) and 4.4°C for a very high GHG  emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5)30, with narrower uncertainty ranges31 than for \\ncorresponding scenarios in AR5. { Cross-Section Boxes 1 and 2, 3.1.1, 3.3.4, Table 3.1, 4.3 } (Box SPM.1 )\\nB.1.2  Discernible differences in trends of global surface temperature between contrasting GHG emissions scenarios ( SSP1-1.9 \\nand SSP1-2.6 vs. SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5) would begin to emerge from natural variability32 within around 20 years. Under \\nthese contrasting scenarios, discernible effects would emerge within years for GHG concentrations, and sooner for air \\nquality improvements, due to the combined targeted air pollution controls and strong and sustained methane emissions \\nreductions.  Targeted reductions of air pollutant emissions lead to more rapid improvements in air quality within years \\ncompared to reductions in GHG emissions only, but in the long term, further improvements are projected in scenarios \\nthat combine efforts to reduce air pollutants as well as GHG emissions33.

Global surface \\ntemperature in any single year can vary above or below the long-term human-caused trend, due to natural variability. The internal variability of global \\nsurface temperature in a single year is estimated to be about ±0.25°C (5–95% range, high confidence ). The occurrence of individual years with global \\nsurface temperature change above a certain level does not imply that this global warming level has been reached.  {4.3, Cross-Section Box.2 }\\n29 Median five-year interval at which a 1.5°C global warming level is reached (50% probability) in categories of modelled pathways considered in WGIII is \\n2030–2035. By 2030, global surface temperature in any individual year could exceed 1.5°C relative to 1850–1900 with a probability between 40% and \\n60%, across the five scenarios assessed in WGI ( medium confidence ). In all scenarios considered in WGI except the very high emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5), \\nthe midpoint of the first 20-year running average period during which the assessed average global surface temperature change reaches 1.5°C lies in the \\nfirst half of the 2030s.

The assessment does not account for changes in extreme sea level beyond those directly induced by \\nmean sea level rise; risk levels could increase if other changes in extreme sea levels were considered (e.g., due to changes in cyclone intensity). “No-to-moderate \\nresponse” describes efforts as of today (i.e., no further significant action or new types of actions). “Maximum potential response” represent a combination of \\nresponses implemented to their full extent and thus significant additional efforts compared to today, assuming minimal financial, social and political barriers. \\n(In this context, ‘today’ refers to 2019.)

The likelihood of abrupt and/or \\nirreversible changes increases with higher global warming levels. Similarly, the probability \\nof low- likelihood outcomes associated with potentially very large adverse impacts increases \\nwith higher global warming levels. ( high confidence ) {3.1}\\nB.3.1 Limiting global surface temperature does not prevent continued changes in climate system components that have \\nmulti-decadal or longer timescales of response (high confidence ). Sea level rise is unavoidable for centuries to millennia \\ndue to continuing deep ocean warming and ice sheet melt, and sea levels will remain elevated for thousands of years \\n(high confidence ). However, deep, rapid, and sustained GHG emissions reductions would limit further sea level rise \\nacceleration and projected long-term sea level rise commitment. Relative to 1995–2014, the likely global mean sea \\nlevel rise under the SSP1-1.9 GHG emissions scenario is 0.15–0.23 m by 2050 and 0.28–0.55 m by 2100; while for the \\nSSP5-8.5 GHG emissions scenario it is 0.20–0.29 m by 2050 and 0.63–1.01 m by 2100 (medium confidence) . Over the \\nnext 2000 years, global mean sea level will rise by about 2–3 m if warming is limited to 1.5°C and 2–6 m if limited to \\n2°C ( low confidence ). {3.1.3, Figure 3.4 } (Box SPM.1 )\\nB.3.2 The likelihood and impacts of abrupt and/or irreversible changes in the climate system, including changes triggered \\nwhen tipping points are reached, increase with further global warming (high confidence ). As warming levels increase, so \\ndo the risks of species extinction or irreversible loss of biodiversity in ecosystems including forests (medium confidence) , \\ncoral reefs (very high confidence ) and in Arctic regions (high confidence ). At sustained warming levels between 2°C and \\n3°C, the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets will be lost almost completely and irreversibly over multiple millennia, \\ncausing several metres of sea level rise (limited evidence ).

Six feasibility dimensions (economic, technological, institutional, social, environmental and \\ngeophysical) were used to calculate the potential feasibility of climate responses  and adaptation options, along with their synergies with mitigation. For \\npotential feasibility and feasibility dimensions, the figure shows high, medium, or low feasibility. Synergies with mitigation are identified as high, medium, and  \\nlow. The right-hand side of Panel a provides an overview of selected mitigation options and their estimated costs and potentials in 2030. Costs are net lifetime \\ndiscounted monetary costs of avoided GHG emissions calculated relative to a reference technology. Relative potentials and costs will vary by place, context and \\ntime and in the longer term compared to 2030. The potential (horizontal axis) is the net GHG emission reduction (sum of reduced emissions and/or enhanced \\nsinks) broken down into cost categories (coloured bar segments) relative to an emission baseline consisting of current policy (around 2019) reference scenarios \\nfrom the AR6 scenarios database. The potentials are assessed independently for each option and are not additive. Health system mitigation options are included \\nmostly in settlement and infrastructure (e.g., efficient healthcare buildings) and cannot be identified separately. Fuel switching in industry refers to switching \\nto electricity, hydrogen, bioenergy and natural gas. Gradual colour transitions indicate uncertain breakdown into cost categories due to uncertainty or heavy \\ncontext dependency. The uncertainty in the total potential is typically 25–50%. Panel (b) displays the indicative potential of demand-side mitigation options \\nfor 2050. Potentials are estimated based on approximately 500 bottom-up studies representing all global regions. The baseline (white bar) is provided by the \\nsectoral mean GHG emissions in 2050 of the two scenarios (IEA -STEPS and IP_ModAct) consistent with policies announced by national governments until 2020. \\nThe green arrow represents the demand-side emissions reductions potentials. The range in potential is shown by a line connecting dots displaying the highest \\nand the lowest potentials reported in the literature. Food shows demand-side potential of socio-cultural factors and infrastructure use, and changes in land-use \\npatterns enabled by change in food demand. Demand-side measures and new ways of end-use service provision can reduce global GHG emissions in end- use \\nsectors ( buildings, land transport, food) by 40–70% by 2050 compared to baseline scenarios, while some regions and socioeconomic groups require additional \\nenergy and resources. The last row shows how demand-side mitigation options in other sectors can influence overall electricity demand. The dark grey bar shows \\nthe projected increase in electricity demand above the 2050 baseline due to increasing electrification in the other sectors. Based on a bottom-up assessment, \\nthis projected increase in electricity demand can be avoided through demand-side mitigation options in the domains of infrastructure use and socio-cultural \\nfactors that influence electricity usage in industry, land transport, and buildings (green arrow).  {Figure 4.4 } \\nMitigati on and Adaptation Options across Systems \\nC.3 Rapid and far-reaching transitions across all sectors and systems are necessary to achieve \\ndeep and sustained emissions reductions and secure a liveable and sustainable future for all. \\nThese system transitions involve a significant upscaling of a wide portfolio of mitigation and \\nadaptation options.

Systems transitions \\ninclude: deployment of low- or zero-emission technologies; reducing and changing demand through infrastructure \\ndesign and access, socio-cultural and behavioural changes, and increased technological efficiency and adoption; social \\nprotection, climate services or other services; and protecting and restoring ecosystems ( high confidence ). Feasible, \\neffective, and low-cost options for mitigation and adaptation are already available ( high confidence ).

Large contributions \\nto emissions reductions with costs less than USD 20 tCO 2-eq-1 come from solar and wind energy, energy efficiency \\nimprovements, and methane emissions reductions (coal mining, oil and gas, waste) ( medium confidence ). There are \\nfeasible adaptation options that support infrastructure resilience, reliable power systems and efficient water use for \\nexisting and new energy generation systems ( very high confidence ). Energy generation diversification (e.g., via wind, \\nsolar, small scale hydropower) and demand-side management (e.g., storage and energy efficiency improvements) can \\nincrease energy reliability and reduce vulnerabilities to climate change ( high confidence ). Climate responsive energy \\nmarkets, updated design standards on energy assets according to current and projected climate change, smart-grid \\ntechnologies, robust transmission systems and improved capacity to respond to supply deficits have high feasibility  in \\nthe medium to long term, with mitigation co-benefits ( very high confidence ). {4.5.1 } (Figure SPM.7 )\\n51 In this context, ‘unabated fossil fuels’ refers to fossil fuels produced and used without interventions that substantially reduce the amount of GHG emitted \\nthroughout the life cycle; for example, capturing 90% or more CO 2 from power plants, or 50–80% of fugitive methane emissions from energy supply.'}\n",

Conservation, improved management, and restoration of forests \\nand other ecosystems offer the largest share of economic mitigation potential, with reduced deforestation in tropical \\nregions having the highest total mitigation potential. Ecosystem restoration, reforestation, and afforestation can lead to \\ntrade-offs due to competing demands on land. Minimizing trade-offs requires integrated approaches to meet multiple \\nobjectives including food security. Demand-side measures (shifting to sustainable healthy diets53 and reducing food loss/\\nwaste) and sustainable agricultural intensification can reduce ecosystem conversion, and methane and nitrous oxide \\nemissions, and free up land for reforestation and ecosystem restoration. Sustainably sourced agricultural and forest \\nproducts, including long-lived wood products, can be used instead of more GHG-intensive products in other sectors. \\nEffective adaptation options include cultivar improvements, agroforestry, community-based adaptation, farm and \\nlandscape diversification, and urban agriculture. These AFOLU response options require integration of biophysical, \\nsocioeconomic and other enabling factors.

Additionally, methodological \\nadvances and new datasets have provided a more complete spatial representation of changes in surface temperature, including in the Arctic. These and other improvements \\nhave also increased the estimate of global surface temperature change by approximately 0.1°C, but this increase does not represent additional physical warming since AR5 \\n{WGI SPM A1.2 and footnote 10 }\\n65 For 1850–1900 to 2013–2022 the updated calculations are 1.15 [1.00 to 1.25]°C for global surface temperature, 1.65 [1.36 to 1.90]°C for land temperatures and \\n0.93 [0.73 to 1.04]°C for ocean temperatures above 1850 –1900 using the exact same datasets (updated by 2 years) and methods as employed in WGI. \\n66 The period distinction with the observed assessment arises because the attribution studies consider this slightly earlier period.

Observed Climate System Changes and Impacts to \\nDate\\nIt is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the \\natmosphere, ocean and land. Widespread and rapid changes in \\nthe atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere have occurred \\n(Table 2.1).  The scale of recent changes across the climate system as \\na whole and the present state of many aspects of the climate system \\nare unprecedented over many centuries to many thousands of years. It \\nis very likely  that GHG emissions were the main driver74 of tropospheric \\nwarming and extremely likely that human-caused stratospheric ozone \\ndepletion was the main driver of stratospheric cooling between 1979 \\nand the mid-1990s. It is virtually certain  that the global upper ocean \\n(0-700m) has warmed since the 1970s and extremely likely  that \\nhuman influence is the main driver. Ocean warming accounted for \\n91% of the heating in the climate system, with land warming, ice loss \\nand atmospheric warming accounting for  about 5%, 3% and 1%, \\nrespectively ( high confidence ). Global mean sea level increased by 0.20 \\n[0.15 to 0.25] m between 1901 and 2018. The average rate of sea level \\nrise was 1.3 [0.6 to 2.1]mm yr-1 between 1901 and 1971, increasing to \\n1.9 [0.8 to 2.9] mm yr-1 between 1971 and 2006, and further increasing \\nto 3.7 [3.2 to –4.2] mm yr-1 between 2006 and 2018 ( high confidence ). \\nHuman influence was very likely  the main driver of these increases \\nsince at least 1971 (Figure 3.4). Human influence is very likely  the main \\ndriver of the global retreat of glaciers since the 1990s and the decrease \\nin Arctic sea ice area between 1979–1988 and 2010–2019. Human \\ninfluence has also very likely  contributed to decreased Northern Hemisphere \\nspring snow cover and surface melting of the Greenland ice sheet. It is \\nvirtually  certain that human-caused CO 2 emissions are the main driver \\nof current global acidification of the surface open ocean. { WGI SPM A.1, \\nWGI SPM A.1.3, WGI SPM A.1.5, WGI SPM A.1.6, WG1 SPM A1.7, \\nWGI SPM A.2, WG1.SPM A.4.2; SROCC SPM.A.1, SROCC SPM A.2 }\\nHuman-caused climate change is already affecting many weather and \\nclimate extremes in every region across the globe. Evidence of observed \\nchanges in extremes such as heatwaves, heavy precipitation, droughts, \\nand tropical cyclones, and, in particular, their attribution to human \\ninfluence, has strengthened since AR5 (Figure 2.3).  It is virtually  certain \\nthat hot extremes (including heatwaves) have become more frequent and \\nmore intense across most land regions since the 1950s (Figure 2.3), while cold \\nextremes (including cold waves) have become less frequent and less severe, \\nwith high confidence  that human-caused climate change is the  main \\ndriver of these changes.

The \\nfrequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events have increased \\nsince the 1950s over most land areas for which observational data \\nare sufficient for trend analysis ( high confidence ), and human-caused \\nclimate change is likely  the main driver (Figure 2.3). Human-caused \\nclimate change has contributed to increases in agricultural and ecological \\ndroughts in some regions due to increased land evapotranspiration \\n(medium confidence ) (Figure 2.3). It is likely  that the global proportion \\nof major (Category 3–5) tropical cyclone occurrence has increased over \\nthe last four decades. { WGI SPM A.3, WGI SPM A3.1, WGI SPM A3.2; \\nWGI SPM A3.4; SRCCL SPM.A.2.2; SROCC SPM.

The extent \\nand magnitude of  climate change impacts are larger than estimated \\nin previous assessments ( high confidence ). Approximately half of the \\nspecies assessed globally have shifted polewards or, on land, also to \\nhigher elevations  (very high confidence ).

Panel (a)  The IPCC AR6 WGI inhabited regions are displayed as hexagons with identical size \\nin their approximate geographical location (see legend for regional acronyms). All assessments are made for each region as a whole and for the 1950s to the present. Assessments made \\non different time scales or more local spatial scales might differ from what is shown in the figure. The colours in each panel represent the four outcomes of the assessment on observed \\nchanges. Striped hexagons (white and light-grey) are used where there is low agreement  in the type of change for the region as a whole, and grey hexagons are used when there is limited \\ndata and/or literature that prevents an assessment of the region as a whole. Other colours indicate at least medium confidence  in the observed change. The confidence level for the human \\ninfluence on these observed changes is based on assessing trend detection and attribution and event attribution literature, and it is indicated by the number of dots: three dots for \\nhigh confidence , two dots for medium confidence  and one dot for low confidence  (single, filled dot: limited agreemen t; single, empty dot: limited evidence ). For hot extremes, the evidence \\nis mostly drawn from changes in metrics based on daily maximum temperatures; regional studies using other indices (heatwave duration, frequency and intensity) are used in addition. For \\nheavy precipitation, the evidence is mostly drawn from changes in indices based on one-day or five-day precipitation amounts using global and regional studies. Agricultural and \\necological droughts are assessed based on observed and simulated changes in total column soil moisture, complemented by evidence on changes in surface soil moisture, water \\nbalance ( precipitation minus evapotranspiration) and indices driven by precipitation and atmospheric evaporative demand. Panel (b) shows the average level of vulnerability amongst a \\ncountry’s population against 2019 CO 2-FFI emissions per- capita per country for the 180 countries for which both sets of metrics are available. Vulnerability information is based on two \\nglobal indicator systems, namely INFORM and World Risk Index. Countries with a relatively low average vulnerability often have groups with high vulnerability within their population and \\nvice versa. The underlying data includes, for example, information on poverty, inequality, health care infrastructure or insurance coverage. Panel (c)  Observed impacts on ecosystems \\nand human systems attributed to climate change at global and regional scales. Global assessments focus on large studies, multi-species, meta-analyses and large reviews. Regional \\nassessments consider evidence on impacts across an entire region and do not focus on any country in particular. For human systems, the direction of impacts is assessed and both \\nadverse and positive impacts have been observed e.g., adverse impacts in one area or food item may occur with positive impacts in another area or food item (for more details and \\nmethodology see WGII SMTS.1).

For example, common \\nadaptation responses in agriculture – adopting improved cultivars and \\nagronomic practices, and changes in cropping patterns and crop \\nsystems – will become less effective from 2°C to higher levels of \\nwarming ( high confidence ). The effectiveness of most water-related \\nadaptation options to reduce projected risks declines with increasing \\nwarming ( high confidence ).

For every \\n1000 GtCO 2 emitted by human activity, global mean temperature rises \\nby likely  0.27°C to 0.63°C (best estimate of 0.45°C). This relationship \\nimplies that there is a finite carbon budget that cannot be exceeded in \\norder to limit warming to any given level. { WGI SPM D.1, WGI SPM D.1.1; \\nSR1.5 SPM C.1.3 } (Figure 3.5 )\\nThe best estimates of the remaining carbon budget (RCB) from \\nthe beginning of 2020 for limiting warming to 1.5°C with a 50% \\nlikelihood127 is estimated to be 500 GtCO 2; for 2°C (67% likelihood) \\nthis is 1150 GtCO 2.128 Remaining carbon budgets have been quantified \\nbased on the assessed value of TCRE and its uncertainty, estimates of \\nhistorical warming, climate system feedbacks such as emissions from \\nthawing permafrost, and the global surface temperature change after \\nglobal anthropogenic CO 2 emissions reach net zero, as well as variations \\nin projected warming from non-CO 2 emissions due in part to mitigation \\naction.  The stronger the reductions in non-CO 2 emissions the lower the \\nresulting temperatures  are for a given RCB or the larger RCB for the \\nsame level of temperature change. For instance, the RCB for limiting \\nwarming to 1.5°C with a 50% likelihood could vary between 300 to \\n600 GtCO 2 depending on non-CO 2 warming129. Limiting warming to 2°C \\nwith a 67% (or 83%) likelihood would imply a RCB of 1150 (900) GtCO 2 \\nfrom the beginning of 2020. To stay below 2°C with a 50% likelihood, \\nthe RCB is higher, i.e., 1350 GtCO 2130. {WGI SPM D.1.2, WGI Table SPM.2; \\nWGIII Box SPM.1, WGIII Box 3.4; SR1.5 SPM C.1.3 }\\n126 See Annex I: Glossary. \\n127 This likelihood is based on the uncertainty in transient climate response to cumulative net CO 2 emissions and additional Earth system feedbacks and provides the probability that \\nglobal warming will not exceed the temperature levels specified. {WGI Table SPM.1 }\\n128 Global databases make different choices about which emissions and removals occurring on land are considered anthropogenic. Most countries report their anthropogenic \\nland CO 2 fluxes including fluxes due to human-caused environmental change (e.g., CO 2 fertilisation) on ‘managed’ land in their National GHG inventories. Using emissions \\nestimates based on these inventories, the remaining carbon budgets must be correspondingly reduced. {WGIII SPM Footnote 9, WGIII TS.3, WGIII Cross-Chapter Box 6 }\\n129 The central case RCB assumes future non-CO 2 warming (the net additional contribution of aerosols and non-CO 2 GHG) of around 0.1°C above 2010 –2019 in line with stringent \\nmitigation scenarios. If additional non-CO 2 warming is higher, the RCB for limiting warming to 1.5°C with a 50% likelihood shrinks to around 300 GtCO 2. If, however, additional \\nnon-CO 2 warming is limited to only 0.05°C (via stronger reductions of CH 4 and N 2O through a combination of deep structural and behavioural changes, e.g., dietary changes), \\nthe RCB could be around 600 GtCO 2 for 1.5°C warming. {WGI Table SPM.2, WGI Box TS.7; WGIII Box 3.4 }\\n130 When adjusted for emissions since previous reports, these RCB estimates are similar to SR1.5 but larger than AR5 values due to methodological improvements.  {WGI SPM D.1.3 }\\n131 Uncertainties for total carbon budgets have not been assessed and could affect the specific calculated fractions. \\n132 See footnote 131. \\n133 These projected adjustments of carbon sinks to stabilisation or decline of atmospheric CO 2 concentrations are accounted for in calculations of remaining carbon budgets. \\n{WGI SPM footnote 32 }If the annual CO 2 emissions between 2020–2030 stayed, on average,  \\nat the same level as 2019, the resulting cumulative emissions would \\nalmost exhaust the remaining carbon budget for 1.5°C (50%), and \\nexhaust more than a third of the remaining carbon budget for 2°C \\n(67%) (Figure 3.5). Based on central estimates only, historical cumulative \\nnet CO 2 emissions between 1850 and 2019 (2400 ±240 GtCO 2) amount \\nto about four-fifths131 of the total carbon budget for a 50% probability of \\nlimiting global warming to 1. 5°C (central estimate about  2900 GtCO 2) and \\nto about two-thirds132 of the total carbon budget for a 67% probability \\nto limit global warming to 2°C  (central estimate about 3550 GtCO 2). \\n{WGI Table SPM.2; WGIII SPM B.1.3, WGIII Table 2.1 }\\nIn scenarios with increasing CO 2 emissions, the land and ocean  \\ncarbon sinks are  projected to be less effective at slowing the \\naccumulation of CO 2 in the atmosphere  (high confidence ).

Reductions \\nin GHG emissions in industry, transport, buildings, and urban areas \\ncan be achieved through a combination of energy efficiency and \\nconservation and a transition to low-GHG technologies and energy \\ncarriers (see also 4.5, Figure 4.4). Socio-cultural options and behavioural \\nchange can reduce global GHG emissions of end-use sectors, with most \\nof the potential in developed countries, if combined with improved \\n136 CCS is an option to reduce emissions from large-scale fossil-based energy and industry sources provided geological storage is available. When CO 2 is captured directly from the \\natmosphere (DACCS), or from biomass (BECCS), CCS provides the storage component of these CDR methods. CO 2 capture and subsurface injection is a mature technology for \\ngas processing and enhanced oil recovery. In contrast to the oil and gas sector, CCS is less mature in the power sector, as well as in cement and chemicals production, where it \\nis a critical mitigation option. The technical geological storage capacity is estimated to be on the order of 1000 GtCO 2, which is more than the CO 2 storage requirements through \\n2100 to limit global warming to 1.5°C, although the regional availability of geological storage could be a limiting factor. If the geological storage site is appropriately selected and \\nmanaged, it is estimated that the CO 2 can be permanently isolated from the atmosphere. Implementation of CCS currently faces technological, economic, institutional, ecological \\nenvironmental and socio-cultural barriers. Currently, global rates of CCS deployment are far below those in modelled pathways limiting global warming to 1.5°C to 2°C.

Panel (a) presents selected mitigation and adaptation options across different systems. The left hand side \\nof panel (a) shows climate responses and adaptation options assessed for their multidimensional feasibility at global scale, in the near term and up to 1.5°C global warming. As \\nliterature above 1.5°C is limited, feasibility at higher levels of warming may change, which is currently not possible to assess robustly. The term response is used here in addition to \\nadaptation because some responses, such as migration, relocation and resettlement may or may not be considered to be adaptation. Migration, when voluntary, safe and orderly, \\nallows reduction of risks to climatic and non-climatic stressors. Forest based adaptation includes sustainable forest management, forest conservation and restoration, reforestation \\nand afforestation. WASH refers to water, sanitation and hygiene. Six feasibility dimensions (economic, technological, institutional, social, environmental and geophysical) were used \\nto calculate the potential feasibility of climate responses and adaptation options, along with their synergies with mitigation. For potential feasibility and feasibility dimensions, the \\nfigure shows high, medium, or low feasibility. Synergies with mitigation are identified as high, medium, and low. The right-hand side of panel (a) provides an overview of selected \\nmitigation options and their estimated costs and potentials in 2030. Relative potentials and costs will vary by place, context and time and in the longer term compared to 2030. Costs \\nare net lifetime discounted monetary costs of avoided greenhouse gas emissions calculated relative to a reference technology. The potential (horizontal axis) is the quantity of net \\nGHG emission reduction that can be achieved by a given mitigation option relative to a specified emission baseline. Net GHG emission reductions are the sum of reduced emissions \\nand/or enhanced sinks. The baseline used consists of current policy (around 2019) reference scenarios from the AR6 scenarios database (25–75 percentile values). The mitigation \\npotentials are assessed independently for each option and are not necessarily additive. Health system mitigation options are included mostly in settlement and infrastructure \\n(e.g., efficient healthcare buildings) and cannot be identified separately. Fuel switching in industry refers to switching to electricity, hydrogen, bioenergy and natural gas. The length \\nof the solid bars represents the mitigation potential of an option. Potentials are broken down into cost categories, indicated by different colours (see legend). Only discounted lifetime \\nmonetary costs are considered. Where a gradual colour transition is shown, the breakdown of the potential into cost categories is not well known or depends heavily on factors such \\nas geographical location, resource availability, and regional circumstances, and the colours indicate the range of estimates. The uncertainty in the total potential is typically 25–50%. \\nWhen interpreting this figure, the following should be taken into account: (1) The mitigation potential is uncertain, as it will depend on the reference technology (and emissions) \\nbeing displaced, the rate of new technology adoption, and several other factors; (2) Different options have different feasibilities beyond the cost aspects, which are not reflected in \\nthe figure; and (3) Costs for accommodating the integration of variable renewable energy sources in electricity systems are expected to be modest until 2030, and are not included. \\nPanel (b) displays the indicative potential of demand-side mitigation options for 2050. Potentials are estimated based on approximately 500 bottom-up studies representing all \\nglobal regions. The baseline (white bar) is provided by the sectoral mean GHG emissions in 2050 of the two scenarios (IEA-STEPS and IP_ModAct) consistent with policies announced \\nby national governments until 2020. The green arrow represents the demand-side emissions reductions potentials. The range in potential is shown by a line connecting dots displaying \\nthe highest and the lowest potentials reported in the literature. Food shows demand-side potential of socio-cultural factors and infrastructure use, and changes in land-use patterns \\nenabled by change in food demand. Demand-side measures and new ways of end-use service provision can reduce global GHG emissions in end-use sectors ( buildings, land transport, \\nfood) by 40–70% by 2050 compared to baseline scenarios, while some regions and socioeconomic groups require additional energy and resources. The last row shows how demand-\\nside mitigation options in other sectors can influence overall electricity demand. The dark grey bar shows the projected increase in electricity demand above the 2050 baseline due \\nto increasing electrification in the other sectors. Based on a bottom-up assessment, this projected increase in electricity demand can be avoided through demand-side mitigation \\noptions in the domains of infrastructure use and socio-cultural factors that influence electricity usage in industry, land transport, and buildings (green arrow).  {WGII Figure SPM.4, \\nWGII Cross-Chapter Box FEASIB in Chapter 18; WGIII SPM C.10, WGIII 12.2.1, WGIII 12.2.2, WGIII Figure SPM.6, WGIII Figure SPM.7 }\\n4.5.1.

In \\nother contexts, social protection may be used synonymously with social \\npolicy and can be described as all public and private initiatives that \\nprovide access to services, such as health , education, or housing, or \\nincome and consumption transfers to people. Social protection policies \\nprotect the poor and  vulnerable  against livelihood risks and enhance \\nthe social status and rights of the marginalized, as well as prevent \\nvulnerable  people from falling into poverty. \\n \\nSolar radiation modification (SRM) \\nRefers to a range of radiation modification measures not related to \\ngreenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation  that seek to limit global warming . \\nMost methods involve reducing the amount of incoming solar radiation  \\nreaching the surface, but others also act on the longwave radiation \\nbudget by reducing optical thickness and cloud lifetime. \\n \\nSource \\nAny process or activity which releases a greenhouse gas , an aerosol  \\nor a precursor of a greenhouse gas into the atmosphere . See also:  \\nPool - carbon and nitrogen , Reservoir , Sequestration , Sequestration \\npotential , Sink, Uptake . \\nStranded assets\\nAssets exposed to devaluations or conversion to ‘liabilities’ because \\nof unanticipated changes in their initially expected revenues due \\nto innovations and/or evolutions of the business context, including \\nchanges in public regulations at the domestic and international levels. \\n \\nSustainable development (SD) \\nDevelopment that meets the needs of the present without compromising the \\nability of future generations to meet their own needs and balances social, \\neconomic and environmental concerns. See also: Development pathways , \\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) . Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) \\nThe 17 Global Goals for development for all countries established by the \\nUnited Nations through a  participatory process and elaborated in the \\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development , including ending poverty \\nand hunger; ensuring health and well-being , education, gender equality, \\nclean water and energy, and decent work; building and ensuring resilient \\nand sustainable infrastructure , cities and consumption; reducing \\ninequalities ; protecting land and water ecosystems ; promoting peace, \\njustice  and partnerships; and taking urgent action on climate change . \\nSee also:  Development pathways , Sustainable development (SD) . \\n \\nSustainable land management \\nThe stewardship and use of  land resources, including soils, water, animals \\nand plants, to meet changing human needs, while simultaneously \\nensuring the long-term productive potential of these resources and the \\nmaintenance of their environmental functions. \\n \\nTemperature overshoot \\nExceedance of a specified global warming  level, followed by a decline \\nto or below that level during a specified period of time (e.g., before \\n2100). Sometimes the magnitude and likelihood of the overshoot is also \\ncharacterized. The overshoot duration can vary from one  pathway  to the \\nnext but in most  overshoot pathways  in the literature and referred to as \\novershoot pathways in the AR6, the overshoot occurs over a period of \\nat least one and up to several decades. See also: Overshoot Pathways . \\n \\nTipping point\\nA critical threshold beyond which a system reorganises, often abruptly \\nand/or irreversibly. See also:  Abrupt climate change , Irreversibility , \\nTipping element . \\nTransformation\\nA change in the fundamental attributes of natural  and human systems .\\nTransformational adaptation\\nSee: Adaptation .\\nTransition \\nThe process of changing from one state or condition to another in a \\ngiven period of time. Transition can be in individuals, firms, cities , \\nregions  and nations, and can be based on incremental or  transformative  \\nchange.  \\n  \\nJust transitions \\nA set of principles, processes and practices that aim to ensure \\nthat no people, workers, places, sectors, countries or regions are \\nleft behind in the transition  from a high-carbon to a low-carbon \\neconomy. It stresses the need for targeted and proactive measures \\nfrom governments, agencies, and authorities to ensure that any \\nnegative social, environmental or economic impacts of economy-\\nwide transitions are minimized, whilst benefits are maximized for \\nthose disproportionately affected. Key principles of just transitions \\ninclude: respect and dignity for vulnerable groups; fairness  in energy \\naccess and use, social dialogue and democratic consultation with \\nrelevant stakeholders; the creation of decent jobs; social protection ; \\nand rights at work. Just transitions could include fairness in energy, \\nland use  and climate planning and decision-making processes; '}\n",

Lastly, just transitions may embody the \\nredressing of past harms and perceived injustices. \\n \\nUrban  \\nThe categorisation of areas as “ urban” by government statistical \\ndepartments is generally based either on population size, population \\ndensity, economic base, provision of services, or some combination \\nof the above. Urban systems are networks and nodes of intensive \\ninteraction and exchange including capital, culture, and material \\nobjects. Urban areas exist on a continuum with rural areas and tend to \\nexhibit higher levels of complexity, higher populations and population \\ndensity, intensity of capital investment, and a preponderance of \\nsecondary (processing) and tertiary (service) sector industries. The \\nextent and intensity of these features varies significantly within and \\nbetween urban areas. Urban places and systems are open, with much \\nmovement and exchange between more rural areas as well as other \\nurban regions. Urban areas can be globally interconnected, facilitating \\nrapid flows between them, of capital investment, of ideas and culture, human \\nmigration , and disease. See also: Cities , City region , Peri-urban areas , \\nUrban Systems , Urbanisation .\\n \\nUrbanisation \\nUrbanisation  is a multi-dimensional process that involves at least \\nthree simultaneous changes: 1) land use change : transformation of \\nformerly rural settlements  or natural land into urban settlements ; \\n2) demographic change: a shift in the spatial distribution of a population \\nfrom rural to  urban  areas; and 3) infrastructure  change: an increase in \\nprovision of infrastructure  services including electricity, sanitation, etc. \\nUrbanisation  often includes changes in lifestyle, culture, and behaviour, \\nand thus alters the demographic, economic, and social structure of both \\nurban and rural areas. See also: Settlement , Urban , Urban Systems .\\n \\nVector-borne disease \\nIllnesses caused by parasites, viruses and bacteria that are transmitted \\nby various vectors (e.g. mosquitoes, sandflies, triatomine bugs, blackflies, \\nticks, tsetse flies, mites, snails and lice). \\n \\nVulnerability \\nThe propensity or predisposition to be adversely affected. Vulnerability \\nencompasses a variety of concepts and elements including sensitivity or \\nsusceptibility to harm and lack of capacity to cope and adapt. See also: \\nHazard , Exposure , Impac ts, Risk.\\n  \\nWater security \\nThe capacity of a population to safeguard sustainable access to adequate \\nquantities of acceptable-quality water for sustaining livelihoods , human \\nwell-being  and socio-economic development, for ensuring protection \\nagainst water-borne pollution and water-related disasters and for \\npreserving ecosystems  in a climate of peace and political stability. \\n \\nWell-being \\nA state of existence that fulfills various human needs, including \\nmaterial living conditions and quality of life, as well as the ability \\nto pursue one’s goals, to thrive and to feel satisfied with one’s life. \\nEcosystem well-being refers to the ability of ecosystems  to maintain \\ntheir diversity and quality.
